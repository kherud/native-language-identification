Abstract

OEF Details

Increased interest in web-based education has spurred the proliferation of online learning environments. However, these
platforms suffer from high dropout rates due to lack of sustained motivation among the students taking the course. In an
effort to address this problem, we propose an incentive-based,
instructor-driven approach to orchestrate the interactions in
online educational forums (OEFs). Our approach takes into
account the heterogeneity in skills among the students as well
as the limited budget available to the instructor. We first analytically model OEFs in a non-strategic setting using ideas
from lumpable continuous time Markov chains and compute
expected aggregate transient net-rewards for the instructor and
the students. We next consider a strategic setting where we
use the rewards computed above to set up a mixed-integer linear program which views an OEF as a single-leader-multiplefollowers Stackelberg game and recommends an optimal plan
to the instructor for maximizing student participation. Our
experimental results reveal several interesting phenomena including a striking non-monotonicity in the level of participation of students vis-a-vis the instructor’s arrival rate.

OEFs recorded in a real-world experiment.
Mazzolini and Maddison 2003). The objective of our work
is to propose an instructor-driven approach to orchestrate the
activities of OEFs by designing optimal incentives to enhance student-instructor participation in these OEFs.
Incentive design plays an important role in encouraging
participation among students in these educational forums.
As part of a case study, we analysed the data collected from
two online educational forums which were part of the Game
Theory (E1 254) in the Department of Computer Science
and Automation, Indian Institute of Science, for two different
terms. The primary difference between these two terms was
that there were no incentives offered to students participating
in the Spring 2012 term while in the Spring 2014 term, students were offered incentives (a certain percentage of marks
based on the reward points accumulated by the student) to
participate actively to open-ended (or discussion type) questions posted on the Piazza forum associated with the course.
We observed an increased participation of students in the
incentive-based course than when there were no incentives
offered (See Figure 1) which is an indication of importance
of appropriate incentives in driving up the participation levels in the course.
Modelling incentives for improving the participation levels has also recently been studied by (Ghosh and Kleinberg
2013) where they formulate an incentive-based approach to
modulate the activities of the online educational forums and
recommend optimal behaviour for the instructor needed to
drive up the participation from the student population. We
pursue this direction further and non-trivially extend their
instructor-driven approach to a more realistic setting of heterogeneous students and a budget-limited instructor. On-

Introduction
With the explosive growth of the Internet, the area of
education has undergone a massive transformation in
terms of how students and instructors interact in a classroom. Online learning environments now constitute a very
important part of any academic course. Further, online education has attracted the interest of the research community
due to the immense popularity of the massive open online
courses (MOOCs) offered by platforms like Coursera, edX,
Udacity, etc. As of January 17, 2014, Coursera students
voiced themselves in 590,000 discussion threads in the education forums for a total of 343,014,912 minutes of learning across 571 courses (Coursera 2014). However, empirical studies have repeatedly shown that the dropout rates in
the online courses are very high (Fowler 2013) mainly due
to a lack of sustained motivation among the enrolled students. An important, but often under-utilized component of
an online classroom is the online educational forum (OEF)
where students and instructors discuss various administrative and technical aspects of the course (Andresen 2009;

Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.

line learning environments attract participation from students with heterogeneous skill levels and it is our belief that
any approach to improve levels in participation should account for this heterogeneity which is not considered by existing models. We incentivize students on a per question basis to keep up the momentum of participation in the class.
Students are provided suitable incentives to post answers to
the specific open-ended/discussion-style questions that are
posted on the forum by the instructor. These incentives
maybe in the form of some book vouchers, food coupons or
some extra grade points, as considered appropriate by the
instructor. The instructor is limited by a budget and has to
make judicious use of them such that it results in higher participation levels from different types of students.

Contributions and Outline
Our work requires us to first define an interaction model in
an OEF which reasonably captures the activities of the students and instructor. Once this is addressed, there is a need to
understand transient behaviour of the instructor and students
in the time-limited online course. One of the complexities is
to handle the ‘continuous’ nature of arrivals of the instructor
and students to the OEF. Taking into consideration these factors, we model the OEF as a continuous-time Markov chain
(CTMC). A CTMC is a natural candidate to describe the interaction model as it enables us to record the activities of
all the students and instructor in a simple and elegant manner by appropriately modelling the state space of the CTMC.
Further, it allows the state transitions to happen at any epoch
of time. Using techniques from lumpability of CTMCs, we
compute the transient behaviour of the instructor and the students in the modelled OEF.
Next, we use these computations in a more realistic gametheoretic setting where we adopt a Stackelberg game approach to model the interactions of the OEF. Stackelberg
game models (for example: (An et al. 2011)) have been
the natural approaches in many well-known practical applications primarily in the context of security (for example:
for deploying surveillance resources (Jain et al. 2010) by
the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) police) and
more recently, in traffic patrolling for the Singapore road
network (Brown et al. 2014). We believe that our problem,
though it is set in a different domain of education, fits naturally into a Stackelberg framework where the players of
the game compete on a resource ( i.e., participation time on
the OEF) and the welfare maximizing leader (i.e., instructor) is in a position to exploit the first-mover advantage to
trigger increased participation from the followers (i.e., student population) by designing suitable incentive schemes.
Further, our detailed experiments with the proposed Stackelberg model demonstrate that our approach validates several empirically/theoretically observed phenomena and also,
offers utility-maximizing recommendations to the instructor
as well as the different types of students on several important
parameters (like arrival rate, instructor bias) of the model.
In the rest of the paper, due to space constraints, we sometimes omit providing details in the interest of clarity. These
omitted details are given in (Vallam et al. 2014).

Figure 2: An instructor-driven interaction model in an OEF

Problem Setting
We consider n students and an instructor participating in an
hybrid or online classroom which has an associated discussion forum (termed in this paper as online educational forum (OEF)). In the rest of the paper, we focus on modelling
the instructor-student interactions on the OEF. To achieve the
right focus, we do not consider any other aspect of the online
classroom like lectures, written assignments, exams, etc. We
assume that the arrivals of the n students and the instructor
to the OEF are independent Poisson processes with rate λi
for student i (∀i ∈ {1, . . . , n}) and rate µ for the instructor.
We begin by proposing an instructor-driven approach to
structure the activities in the OEFs (see Figure 2). Henceforth, we will assume the activities of the OEF follows as
outlined in Figure 2. We capture the heterogeneity among
students by allowing L types of students in our OEF. Let Al
be the set of all students of type l (∀l ∈ {1, . . . , L}). Also,
let nl be the number of students of type l. On arrival to the
forum, a student of type l answers the currently open question (if any) and hence, incurs a cost (αl ). We assume that
the cost of answering a question will be same for all students
of a given type. The instructor has a budget B per question
and has to decide a suitable allocation of the budget among
the different students belonging to the L types. Let ml denote the maximum number of answers
P per question that can
be given to Al students i.e., B = 1≤l≤L ml .

A CTMC Model for OEFs
We now model the activities of the OEF (as described in Figure 2) as a CTMC X(t) = (S, Q), where S is the set of states
of the stochastic process X(t) and Q is the generator matrix.
We define each state x ∈ S as: x = (x1 , . . . , xn ), where
xi corresponds to the number of answers received from the
ith student for the current question. If X(t) is in state
x : (x1 , .., xi , .., xn ) and student i gives an answer on the forum then X(t) transitions to state y : (x1 , .., xi + 1, .., xn ).
When the instructor arrives at the forum, the current question

1044

is closed and a new question is started, thus transitioning to
state (0, . . . , 0). At any point of time, there is a single active question on the OEF as given in Figure 2. We assume
the course is of finite duration (T ) and the instructor and the
students are arriving to the forum at finite rates. This allows
us to obtain a reasonably large upper bound M on the number of answers that a student can post on the forum for each
question transforming our infinite state CTMC to a finite state
CTMC where the ‘last’ state will be (M, .., M ). Figure 3(a)
illustrates the CTMC for two students. Thus, the generator
matrix of the
CTMC can be defined as below.

Figure 3: (a) Light-gray and dark-gray regions depict two

Lumpability of the OEF CTMC
An important point to note is that the rewards and costs incurred for each student in a particular state are independent
of the other students and dependent only on their own arrival
rates and the instructor’s arrival rate. This is possible because only open-ended questions are being posted by the instructor and thus, even if an open-ended question has already
been answered by a few students, still a new student can find
it beneficial to give a new answer and potentially earn a good
reward. Hence, instead of analyzing the CTMC, which keeps
track of arrivals of all students (of all types), we show that
we can analyze n independent student-specific CTMCs (with
M +1 states each) so that each of the student-specific CTMC
keeps track of arrivals from only that particular student. This
is possible by applying the lumping process on the original
CTMC which we describe next.
We first define a partition S i on the state space S of
a
X(t) w.r.t. a student i in the OEF as S i = {S i |a ∈
a
{0, 1, . . . , M }} where each block S i of the partition S i is
a
defined as S i = {(xi , x−i ) ∈ S|xi = a}. Figure 3 depicts the lumping process in more detail through an example.
We now state and prove a result about the lumpability of the
proposed CTMC into smaller, student-specific CTMCs. For
ease of notation, note that all the notations with an overline
refer quantities corresponding to the lumped CTMC.

Proof. (Sketch) (i) X(t) is lumpable w.r.t S i if for any two blocks

maybe represented as: v = (a, v−i ) and y = (a, y−i ) respectively.

Let us define RT as the total aggregate reward over time T

X i (t) i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}. The instructor values each answer

Proof. (Sketch) (a) The CTMC X(t) being considered has a finite
state space S and the arrival rates of the students and the instructor
on the CTMC are already known. Due to finiteness, we can assume
there exists a finite number qb < ∞ which bounds the rate entries
in the rate matrices Q and Qi (∀i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}). The initial
state distributions π 0 and π 0i for the CTMCs X(t) and X i (t) respectively are defined as π 0 (0, 0, . . . , 0) = 1, π 0 (y) = 0∀y ∈

is the transient probability being in state x at time t. Let rI,i
denote the reward accrued to the instructor due to answers
posted from student i. If the instructor arrives on the forum
when X i (t) is in state x, the reward she receives will be given
by: rI,i (x) = xδ log µ . Let cost per arrival of the instructor be
denoted by β. Then the net-reward to the instructor will be:

We now have n lumped-CTMCs X i (t) = (S i , Qi ), 1 ≤
i ≤ n (See Figure 3(b) and Figure 3(c)) with finite state space
x
S i = {x|x ∈ {0, 1, . . . , M }}. Each block S i ∈ S i has
been represented as a state x of the lumped-CTMC X i (t)
i.e. a state x of the lumped-CTMC X i (t) is representative of
x
the block S i which contains all the states in S in which the
student i arrives x number of times. Each state x ∈ S i thus
simply means how many answers have been received from
a
student i. For notational ease, we sometimes denote S i as a.
t
Also, let π i denote the transient state probability vector for
the lumped CTMC X i (t). Transient state probability π ti (x)
is the probability of X i (t) being in the state x at a time instant

Note that ψ i∗ is the optimal rate of arrival of student i of
Al in response to instructor strategy φ. We note that students belonging to the same type can have different optimal strategies in response to the same instructor strategy as
the optimization problem can have multiple solutions. Due
to symmetry (with respect to cost αl ) among students belonging to the same type, we assume that students belonging
to the same type will choose the same optimal strategy i.e.
ψ i∗ = ψ j∗ = ψ l∗ ∀i, j ∈ Al . Hence, instead of solving the
student optimization problem for each student i, j belonging
to a particular type Al , we can just solve the student optimization problem for a single representative Al student (now represented as l) and her optimal policy ψ l∗ would be followed
by each student i of Al . Thus the optimization problem to be
solved by each representative student l (1 ≤ l ≤ L) will be :

OEF as a Stackelberg Game

We consider a strategic setting where the instructor’s goal
is to maximize students’ participation in the OEF which results in a better understanding of the subject for the students.
The students typically will have commitments towards other
courses and hence, their objective will be to maximize the
rewards they get from answering questions in the OEF while
minimizing their cost. We model the strategic interactions
in an OEF as a Stackelberg game where the players are n
students enrolled for the course and the instructor offering
the online course. The instructor acts as a leader who decides her strategy (rate of arrival) first and the students are
the followers who, after observing the instructor’s strategy,
will finalize their own strategies (rates of arrival) in order
to maximize their utilities. We assume the strategy space of
the players is finite. The key idea behind the formulation of
the Stackelberg game is to link the expected net-rewards of
the CTMC (when the strategies are known to the model) to
the strategic scenario where the players are optimizing their
corresponding utility functions. We make this intuition clear
in the following subsections by defining the utility functions
of the students and instructor and formulating a bi-level optimization problem which yields the optimal instructor and
students’ strategies. We denote the finite strategy set of the
instructor and the students by Gins (of size v) and Gst (of
size w) respectively. Let Gins = {∆a |a ∈ {1, .., v}, ∆a ∈
[0, qb]}. Let Gst = {Λb |b ∈ {1, .., w}, Λb ∈ [0, qb]}. Let
φ = (φ1 , · · · , φv ) be any arbitrary mixed strategy for the ini

structor and correspondingly, let ψ i = (ψ1i , · · · , ψw
arbitrary mixed strategy for student i. For example, the value
φa is the proportion of times that pure strategy ∆a is used by
the instructor while the value ψbi represents the proportion
of times in which pure strategy Λb is used by student i. Let
Ω(Gins ) and Ω(Gst ) be the probability simplices for instructor and students respectively.

Instructor Optimization Problem
We define aggregate transient utility UTI to the instructor
when she has fixed her strategy as φ and the n students have
fixed their policies as ψ i (1 ≤ i ≤ n). We define net-reward
matrix B T,I,i for the instructor corresponding to each stuT,I,i
dent i where the entry Ba,b
denotes the aggregate utility
(over time T ) received by the instructor w.r.t. student i’s
arrivals, if student i chooses Λb and instructor the strategy
∆a . The expected transient aggregate utility of the instructor

Proposition 2. The net-reward matrices B T,I,i , B T,I,j for the
instructor w.r.t. students i, j belonging to Al have the following
property: B T,I,i = B T,I,j (= B T,I,l ).

Student Optimization Problem

We define expected net-reward matrix DT,l,i for each student
T,l,i
i of type l where each entry of the matrix (Da,b
) denotes
the expected transient aggregate net-reward received by student i of Al when she chooses pure strategy Λb and instructor chooses the pure strategy ∆a . Now, suppose the instructor fixes a (pure/mixed) strategy φ and the student i fixes a
(pure/mixed) strategy ψ i . The expected transient aggregate

The instructor is the leader, so she chooses her policy φ

question to answers from Type 1 students), m2 (budget for
Type 2 students) where each parameter takes values: α1 ∈
{0.01, 0.1, 0.2}, α2 ∈ {0.8, 0.9, 0.99}, m1 , m2 ∈ {2, 6, 10}
resulting in 81 (i.e., 3×3×3×3) configurations. We first set
the instructor bias as a low value (c1 = (0.01/n1 )) for a Type
1 student and as a high value (c2 = (0.99/n2 )) for a Type 2
student where n1 and n2 are number of students of Type 1
and 2 respectively. We run the experiment for each configuration separately. As we are dealing with output from multiple experiments, we generate a scatter plot depicting optimal
participation rates for a Type 1 student (Figure 5 (a)). We
change the instructor behaviour to have high bias towards a
Type 1 student and very low bias towards a Type 2 student
fixing c1 = (0.99/n1 ) and c2 = (0.01/n2 ) and run the experiments similarly for the 81 parameter configurations as
given above. The optimal arrival rates of a Type 1 student
in this scenario is given in Figure 5(b). In Figures 5(a)-(b),
each point is identified by a number between 1 and 81 and
denotes the optimal rate for Type 1 student obtained for the
corresponding experimental configuration.
We observe that, if the instructor’s bias towards Student 1
is low then there are configurations when Type 1 student will
not participate even for medium and high rewards (for example: configs 45, 56 in Figure 5(a) have optimal rate as 0)
whereas if the instructor’s bias towards Type 1 students is
high, then these students start participating enthusiastically
with high rates for medium and high rewards and increase
their participation levels even for the lower rewards (for example: configs 45, 56 in Figure 5(a) have optimal rate 10
while config 09 improved from rate 0 in Figure 5(a) to rate
4 in Figure 5(b)). A similar observation can be made for the
other type of students. Due to redundancy, we do not show
the corresponding graph here. Thus, our model is able to incorporate the effect of instructor bias in deciding the optimal
participation level for the different types of students.
As part of our future work, we intend to capture the effect of student’s effort for answering a question in the OEF.
Further, other ways for modelling OEFs ( for example: using
Markov decision processes) could be considered. Empirical
validations of these results hold promise as well.

MILP Formulation
The mixed integer quadratic program (MIQP) formulated
above can be converted to a mixed integer linear program
(MILP) by following the well-known approach (See Proposition 2 in (Paruchuri et al. 2008)) where they solve a
Bayesian Stackelberg game by reducing to an MILP.

Numerical Experiments

We solve the MILP using ILOG-CPLEX (ILOG 2014)
software and study the changing dynamics of the studentinstructor interactions in an online classroom by varying the
different parameters of the model. We first study the variation in the optimal student participation rate (λ∗ ) of the
heterogeneous student population with µ (instructor arrival
rate) and m (budget of instructor) for different student types
in Figure 4(a)-(d). Let α denote the cost per arrival to the
OEF (and answering an open question if any) of a student.
Figure 4(a) represents scenario for an excellent student (i.e.,
α = 0.3). If we fix m, we can observe that λ∗ keeps increasing with changing µ. This means that these type of students
are quite self motivated and keep posting on the OEF in spite
of µ being very high. This is akin to the phenomenon of
super-posters (Huang et al. 2014) when there are some students who always aggressively post on the OEF. Figure 4(b)
represents scenario for good student (i.e., α = 0.6). We can
observe a similar behaviour but for low rewards, we can see a
dip in the participation rates. Figure 4(c)-(d) denote scenarios for weak students (α ∈ {0.8, 0.9}). However, we observe
non-monotonic participation patterns for students with high
cost per arrival (α = 0.8, 0.9) in Figures 4(c) and 4(d) as
λ∗ initially increases with increasing µ and then, with any
further increase in µ, λ∗ starts falling. This trend has been
noted theoretically (in the homogeneous setting) in literature
(Ghosh and Kleinberg 2013).
Now, assume there are only two student types in the class:
Type 1 (excellent students) and Type 2 (weak students). We
fix these parameters: α1 , α2 , m1 (budget allocated per
