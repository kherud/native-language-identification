ABSTRACT
This paper reports a crowdsourcing experiment on the identification and classification of event
types in Italian. The data collected show that the task is not trivial (360 trusted judgments
collected vs. 475 untrsuted ones) but it has been shown to be linguistically felicitous. The overall
accuracy of the annotation is 61.6%. A reliability threshold assigned to the workers allows us
to indentify the sub-population who has the awareness to perform this complex task and the
accuracy of this sub-population is raised to 93%. Our hypothesis is that although the initial
crowdsourced data is necessarily noisy, it can yield high quality results if the sub-population of
‘good’ workers can be identified. In other words, crowdsourcing offers a solution to difficult
annotation tasks as long as there is an effective way to identify the reliable workers.

Questo articolo descrive un esperimento di crowdsourcing per il riconoscimento e la
classificazione dei tipi di evento in Italiano. I dati raccolti mostrano che il compito non è banale
(360 giudizi affidabili vs. 475 giudizi non affidabili), ma dimostra di essere linguisticamente
“felice”. L’accuratezza globale della annotazione è del 61,6%. Una soglia di affidabilità
assegnata ai lavoratori ci permette di identificare la sotto-popolazione che ha la consapevolezza
di svolgere questo compito complesso la cui accuratezza arriva fino al 93%. La nostra ipotesi è
che, sebbene i dati iniziali ottenuti tramite tecniche di crowdsourcing siano necessariamente
rumorosi, dei risultati di buona qualità possono essere ottenuti se la sotto-popolazione di
"buoni" lavoratori è identificabile. In altre parole, il crowdsourcing offre una soluzione per
compiti di annotazione difficili finché vi è un modo efficace per identificare i lavoratori
affidabili.

Introduction

Many Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems are based on supervised learning approaches
relying on large amounts of manually annotated training data collected by domain experts. Such
annotation process is highly expensive both in terms of money and time. However, the absence
of manually annotated Language Resources (LRs) makes supervised NLP systems subject to
the so-called knowledge acquisition bottleneck. In recent years, in order to facilitate the
development of LRs, two different approaches have been tackled. The first aims at automatically
acquiring LRs, such as lexica, from large corpus data (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Korhonen et
al., 2006, among others). The second investigates the exploitation of the Web 2.0 through the
use of crowdsourcing techniques, i.e. by using non-expert annotators recruited on the Web.
The crucial motivation of crowdsourcing is that when a simple linguistic task is performed by a
population much larger than the sampling allowable by traditional experiments, interesting and
hitherto unobserved distributional properties of human behaviors may emerge. In addition to
this, for Language Technology, the additional motivation is that a web-based crowd can provide
data for the construction of large-scale LRs in a faster, cheaper and still reliable way.
So far, annotation works conducted by means of crowsourcing techniques have focused on rather
simple linguistic tasks, such as the evaluation of automatic translations (Callison-Burch, 2009),
word sense disambiguation (Snow et al., 2008; Akkaya et al., 2010, Rumshinsky, 2011), textual
entailment (Snow et.al., 2008; Wang and Callison-Burch, 2010), commonsense knowledge
(Gordon et al., 2010), text alignment for machine translations (Ambati and Vogel, 2010) and
speech transcriptions (Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010) among others. Such choices are in line
with the idea of using the “wisdom of the crowd” as the tasks can be simplified and presented
to the workers as a sort of online game such that a large percentage of the population can be
expected to perform the task reliably.
In this work we explore the untapped strength of crowdsourcing when the linguistic task is a
complex and challenging one, trying to understand “how far can go the crowd?”. As mentioned,
the received wisdom is that when the tasks are complex, crowdsourced data may be too noisy
to use. However, the noise may come in two ways. One possibility is that the data is noisy
across the board. The other possibility is that the data is noisy from those who are not able to
perform these tasks well but clean from those who perform well. The latter scenario seems
promising since we learn from our experience that regardless of how difficult a task is, there
will be someone good at it if a big enough population is searched. In other words, by sheer size,
crowdsourcing should in principle be able to provide good quality data for more complex tasks
difficult to obtain otherwise. The challenge is to separate the reliable crowd from the unreliable
one.
In this paper, we study the complex task of event type classification and detection. The
remainder of this work will be structured as follows: in Section 2 we will report the theoretical
framework we have adopted for the analysis of the event type. In Section 3 the task of event
type classification through crowdsourcing techniques will be described. Section 4 analyzes and
comments on the results obtained. Finally, we reports on the conclusions and future work.

Event Types: theoretical background

The event type, lexical aspect or aktionsaart, is a lexical category and represents the intrinsic
temporal structure associated with eventualities. Though strictly interconnected, the notion of
event type is not to be confused with that of (viewpoint) aspect, which, on the other hand, is a
grammatical category and contributes to the description of an eventuality as being bounded or
unbounded.

1240

The event type is commonly associated with verbs since the range of linguistic tests elaborated so
far in literature are based on syntactic criteria with the aim of identifying homogeneous classes.
As Moens (1987) points out, what is needed as a starting point in an aspectual classification of
verbs are tests based on co-occurrence possibilities of the verb with certain adverbial expressions
or with the progressive and perfect aspect. However, we want to depart from this perspective,
and we claim that the event type applies to all eventualities, independently of their linguistic
realizations. This means that event nouns, like “assemblea” [meeting], can be associated with a
specific event type value.
Vendler’s (1967) seminal work proposed four main classes of event types, namely states,
activities, accomplishments and achievements. Each of these classes can be described in terms of
three basic sematic features such as [+/- homogeneous], [+/- durative] and [+/- dynamic].
For clarity’s sake, one example per class is provided below.
1 The door is closed [state];
2 John ran. [activity]
3 John closed the door [accomplishment]
4 John died [achievement]
In this work we depart from the original approach proposed by Vendler and adopt a different
theoretical backgound following Pustejovsky’s proposals (1991; 1995). With respect to previous
studies based on semantic primitives (Vendler, 1967; Dowty, 1970; Lakoff, 1970 among others),
the theoretical model adopted assumes:
• the existence of a complex subeventual structure for predicates which provides a template
for verbal decomposition and lexical semantics;
• that adverbial modification is described in terms of scope assignement on the event
structure; and
• that semantic arguments within an event structure expression can be mapped on argument
structure in a predictable and systematic way.
Vendler’s classes are thus reorganized from four to three basic event type values, namely: state,
process and transition and defined as follows:
• State: a single event which is evaluated relative to no other event (Example 1);

• Process: a sequence of events which identify the same semantic expression (Example 2);
• Transition: an event which identifies a semantic expression which can be evaluated only
relative to its opponent (Examples 3 and 4).

For the current study, we will not enter into the details of the phenomenon of event composition,
which accounts for the interaction of the basic event types with syntactic constituents and
grammatical categories to form derived event representations (e.g.: the fact that a transition
event occurring at the progressive viewpoint is to be re-classified as a process event).

Crowdsourcing the identification of event type in context

Our goal is the identification and classification of the actual event types of predicates. In this
work, we concentrated on verbs, but we are aiming at extending the work to all predicative
elements, including nominals and adjectives.
Recognizing the event type of a verb in context is not a trivial task (Klavans and Chodorow
1992). Recently, Zarcone and Lenci (2009) have conducted an experiment on the identification
and classification of verb event types in Italian by using three expert annotators. They report
results on classification accuracy ranging between 44% to 73%.
As for our experiment we collected a subset of 100 sentences from a 2,000 sentence corpus
automatically extracted from La Repubblica (Baroni et al., 2004), a large corpus of Italian
newspaper articles containing more that 300 million tokens. The 2,000 sentence corpus has
been created by selecting the 20 most frequent verbs in the corpus La Repubblica which satisfy
the following criteria:
• they must belong to WordNet semantic class of motion or change; and

• they must belong to at least one of the following semantic types in the SIMPLE/CLIPS
Ontology (Ruimy et al., 2003): change of location, move, cause change of location and
cause motion.

For each verb a set of 100 random sentences has been collected. The verbs are: ARRIVARE
[arrive], TORNARE [come back], PASSARE [pass/go], ENTRARE [enter], USCIRE [exit/leave],
SEGUIRE [follow], CORRERE [run], INCONTRARE [meet], SALIRE [climb/rise/go up], MUOVERE [move/raise], TIRARE [throw/pull], PARTIRE [leave/go/depart], SUPERARE [overcome/get over], CADERE [fall], GIRARE [turn/spin/rotate], ALZARE [raise/get up/turn up],
SALTARE [jump], VIAGGIARE [travel], CONDURRE [lead], PROCEDERE [proceed/go on].
The subcorpus of 100 sentences was uploaded on the Crowdflower platform (CF1 ) with the task
name “Classify the verbs”. Following the basic philosophy of crowdsourcing, we have tried to
keep the annotation task for the workers as simple as possible. Thus, we have simplified the
definitions of Pustejovsky’s basic event types in a way that the workers could easily understand
them. The participants were asked to “classify the verbs according to their meaning”. In particular, we have focused the explanation of the task on the idea that each verb meaning could be
grouped into a class which corresponds to one of Pustejovsky’s event type. The annotators were
presented with the following definitions:
• State: the verb describes a condition of something or someone;

• Process: the verb describes/reports that a certain action has taken place, is taking place
or will take place;
• Transition: the verb describes/reports that a certain action has taken place or will take
place and as a consequence of the occurrence of this action there has been a change of
state in the world.
The definitions were accompanied by a number of examples which aimed at clarifying the task.
For each example we provided a paraphrasis of the verb meaning which tried to match the
1

event type definition and the associated event type. For clarity’s sake we report one example of
the instruction below. The verb which the workers have to assign the event type class is in bold.
5 Marco arrivo’ al negozio.
[Marco arrived at the shop.]
Verb meaning: Marco has moved form a place to another and now he’s at the shop.
Event type: TRANSITION
The experiment was set along the following parameters: a.) each worker could analyze a
maximum of 20 sentences; and b.) each sentence could receive a maximum of 10 judgments
from the workers. As for this latter aspect, we considered 10 judgments per sentence as a good
top threshold for validating the annotation quality of the final answers following Snow et al.
(2008)’s analysis.

3.1 Quality control: Gold Standard and worker recruitment
One of the central issues in crowdsourcing is the quality control of the data. In order to filter non
reliable workers and possible spammers, we adopted two strategies. The first strategy exploits
the “Gold Standard” functionality of the CF platform. 15 random sentences were annotated by
an expert with respect to their event type. The Gold Standard will help us in assuring that the
worker’ answers are correct with respect to the instructions. The second strategy is to rely on
altruism instead of monetary reward in recruiting to discourage spammers. For this task, we
did not offer any compensation and recruited our workers by means of a campaign on social
networks such as Facebook and Twitter.
On the basis of the answers to the Gold Standard, each worker receives a reliability score.
This reliability score is useful for evaluating the annotation of subsequent data, i.e. non Gold
Standard items, since it allows to filter out those instances with low values, thus excluding
them from the final data set.

Evaluation

Our purpose in the evaluation is twofold: on the one hand, we are interested in determining
if crowdsourcing can be used to obtain high quality information for complex semantic tasks
or if there is a limit over which expert annotation is required, and, on the other hand, we are
interested in understanding what is the level of awareness of average speakers when involved
in the identification of complex linguistic phenomena like event types.

4.1 Reliability of the crowd
In Table 1 we report the aggregated results. The experiment was available on the Web through
CF for a period of two weeks starting on Feb. 29th this year. 46 people took part in the
experiment providing a total of 835 judgements. Each sentence received at least one judgement.
The first result is the difference between trusted and untrusted judgments. By computing
the judgement percentage per judgement, more than 56% (475 out of 835) of the judgments
expressed have been considered as not reliable according to the Gold Standard filter, thus
providing a first cue on the complexity of this task. On the other hand, it is interesting to notice

that: a.) the accuracy of the trusted workers on the Gold Standard data is surprisingly high
(93%); and b.) the overall accuracy is 61.6%, which qualify the data as reliable, although
noisy. These figures allow a first important generalization: although the task is complex and the
possibility of reducing its complexity are limited due to the task itself (i.e. event type detection),
it is still doable and it is possible to identify a relatively high number of reliable workers. Further
data in support of this analysis can be obtained by observing the distribution of the selected
verbs among the three classes. Provided the verbs’characteristics, the classes of Transition and
Process are by far the most selected event types (48 and 42 assignments out of 100 sentences,
respectively), while the State class is very low (only 10 assignements of of 100).
As a pre-test for determining the worker’s qualification, an initial reliability score of 1.0 is
assigned to each worker and it is reduced by 0.25 for each wrong answer to the Gold Standard
items. The final reliable judgments provided by the CF platform can be grouped along four
main clusters on the basis of this score. Table 2 reports the figures.

Table 2: Reliability clusters of the trusted judgments.
A manual analysis of the data has shown that there is no error in the assignment of the event
type for the items belonging to the first two clusters, i.e. reliability ranging from 1.0 to 0.7.
On the other hand, in the last two clusters, i.e. reliability ranging from 0.67 to 0.33, we
have identified 11 wrong answers. The distribution of the mistakes appears to be balanced
between the two groups as there are 5 mistakes in Cluster 3 and 6 in Cluster 4. Nevertheless,
by observing the corresponding percentages, it clearly appears that the items in the last group,
Cluster 4, are those with the highest error rate and, thus, the least reliable (54.5% error rate in
Cluster 4 vs. 23.8% error rate in Cluster 3). This suggests that the assignment of the event type
cannot be determined only on the basis of a majority voting of the reliable workers and that not
all the data provided by the workers for this specific task can be used as they are. Although
the CF system assigns the event types to non Gold Standard items on the basis of a majority
vote among the judgments of the trusted workers, the reliability score plays a much more
important role in identifying those clusters of data which are problematic. As a consequence for

1244

the development of LRs for complex linguistic information, such as the identification of event
types, the results of this experiment provide some insights. The first is that, in principle, no
linguistic task is too complex to be performed by non-experts, even though the amount of noisy
data is expected to be higher than for easy tasks. In addition to this, reliability scores are more
important that majority voting thus providing support to the development of well-balanced but
small Gold Standards whose main purpose is the identification of those clusters of data which
are more “prone” to contain errors and for which expert post-processing is required. As for our
data, we propose to to set the reliability threshold to 0.7.
Finally, it appears that the correct class can be identified with a minimum of three/four
judgments from reliable workers, as reported in Table 1 where the average number of trusted
judgments per sentence is 3.82.

4.2 Awareness of the crowd
On the basis of the results, we can perform a further analysis on the awareness of the average
speakers on the phenomenon of event type identification and classification. The analysis
we report in this section is preliminary, although in line with what described in Zarcone and
Lenci (2009). Although, average speakers seem to understand the notion of event type, the
identification and classification of this property in the actual linguistic context is not trivial. As
already stated, the fact that we have collected more untrusted judgements than trusted ones is
a direct proof of this fact.
A further element of analysis on this aspect is provided by the the agreement on the correct
class (i.e. majority voting). We have restricted the analysis to the Gold Standard items. The
figures ranges between 43% to 88%. It is interesting to observe that the highest percentages
of agreement are on those cases which express in a more clearcut way the event type. When
facing more complex cases, including also instances of event type shifting, the percentages tend
to split on all three possible classes with small differences.
Finally, it is interesting to observe that the results we have obtained are in line with those of
Zarcone and Lenci (2009). As already stated, Zarcone and Lenci (2009) obtained an agreement
on event type identification and classification ranging from 44% to 73%. In our experiment we
have obtained an agreement per class ranging from 43% to 88%. One of the most interesting
aspect is that they have used three expert annotators while we have used naive ones. These
data support our conclusions on the awareness of the speaker with respect to the event types.

Conclusion and future work
This paper has explored the possibility of using crowdsourcing techniques to collect data for
the identification and classification of event types in context. The most characteristic feature of
this work with respect to previous studies is the difficulty of the task which is proposed to the
non-expert annotators through a crowdsourcing platform.
The results collected provide empirical support to the claim that the identification and classification of event type is not easy (360 trusted judgments vs. 475 untrusted judgments) but, at
the same time, it suggests that crowdsourcing techniques can be applied also to collect complex
semantic information. As a matter of fact, we have obtained an overall accuracy of 61.6% which
can be considered a good threshold for such a complex semantic task, with a top accuracy of
93% on Gold Standard data from trusted workers.
The data collected cannot be used as they are but require an expert post-processing analysis.
However, the expert post-processing can be reduced to a subset of the data, in particular to those

1245

which are below a certain reliability threshold. As for the event type identification, we claim
that such a reliabiliy threshold can be put at 0.7. In this way, the development of annotated
corpora both for testing and training can be facilitated with useful results in terms of reducing
the efforts and costs for the creation of new Language Resources.
As for the issue of quality control, we have exploited the use of Gold Standard data and recruited
motivated workers by means of a campaign on social platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.
This latter element has proved important in avoiding the presence of spammers. As for the
data collected, the combination of majority voting and reliability scores has proven useful for
the identification both of reliable workers and correct data. However, the identification of the
reliable crowd is still an open issue (see Ipeirotis et al., 2010) and better mechanisms of crowd
selection should be integrated into existing (and new) crowdsourcing platforms. The solution
we have adopted is partial though it proved to be efficient.
Finally, it is interesting to notice that average speakers are aware of the notion of event type,
but as the results prove, they have problems to project the event type category on the actual
context of occurrence.
In order to get better results in terms of quality and quantity, we are planning to further exploit
the Gold Standard to identify the subset(s) of participants who is good at the sub-tasks of
annotating each event type separately (i.e. state, activity, and transition respectively). This may
even include workers whose reliability is below the threshold for the whole task (i.e. identify
the three event types), but, on the contrary, is (almost) perfect on the sub-tasks. Moreover, we
will extend this experiment with data from other languages such as English and Chinese to
provide further support to our observations and, most importantly, to the reliability threshold.
Finally, we aim at using the collected data for testing a classifier of event types in context.
This will be the first step of a more complex task involving the identification of event internal
structures (Im and Pustejovsky, 2009; 2010), which will contribute to the development of a
new lexicon on events for complex NLP systems such as Question Answering and Recognizing
Textual Entailment.
