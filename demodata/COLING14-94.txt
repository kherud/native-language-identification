Abstract
This paper proposes the definition, classification and structure of the Kazakh basic phrases, and sets up a
framework for classifying them according to their syntactic functions. Meanwhile, the structure of the
Kazakh basic phrases were analyzed; and the determination of the Kazakh basic phrases collocation and
extraction of the Kazakh basic phrases based on rules were followed. The Maximum Entropy (ME)
model uses for the identification of the phrases from texts and achieved a result of automatic identification of Kazakh phrases with an accuracy of 78.22% based on rules System and additional artificial modification. Design feature of this ME model join rely on templates of Kazakh Word, part of speech, affixes. Experimental results show that the accuracy rate reached 87.89％．

Introduction

Automatic phrase identification is an important task in natural language processing. A phrase is a
group of words that work together. Phrase recognition is a grammatical unit agent between words and
sentences in natural language processing. Phrase identification Parser has been developed for different
languages, for example, the Church's Base NP Recognition for English (Church, 1988). The rule-based
Model and Maximum Entropy Model (ME) are the most commonly used technology for phrase representation and parsing.
Kazakh Language belongs to the Turkish Language group in the Altaic language family. It is an agglutinative language with word structures formed by adding derivational or inflectional affixes to root
words. Phrase identification is also an indispensable part for Kazakh information processing. In the
past a few year, we have put forward methods for Kazakh morphological analysis, which includes
stem extraction, part of speech(POS) tagging, spelling check, etc. Recently, we are working on syntax
parsing, analysis of phrase structure, automatic identification of phrase and in-depth analysis of sentence structure.
Kazakh phrases are syntactic units consisting of two or more than two words. The phrases can be classified into two categories, which are free phrase and fixed phrase. We are exploring methods which
are more suitable for shallow syntactic parsing of Kazakh according to the nature of Kazakh language.
The research includes a systematic study on information regularity and disambiguation of the Kazakh
phrase, and automatic recognition of basic phrases of Kazakh language. We have developed a rulebased method for the automatic recognition of Kazakh basic phrases, and automatic identification of
verb phrase, noun phrase and adjective phrase based on maximum entropy in Kazakh language at the
same time. Moreover, the ambiguity of structures is also resolved based on rules.
This study solves the problem of Kazakh phrase recognition by providing some effective methods.
This sets up a basis for further syntactic process and tree bank building. This research also provides a
way to build database for various fields like knowledge acquisition, syntactic understanding, ChineseKazakh machine translation, the process of large-scale corpus, etc.

In this paper, our work focuses on identifying noun phrases, adjective phrase and verb phrases, which
are the most difficult aspects of Kazakh phrase recognition analysis. This is achieved by using rules
are ME method.

Related work

There are a variety of techniques used for phrase recognition, which include rule-based technique, statistical technique, and a combination of them. Church's (1988) approach used manual or semiautomatic annotation phrase corpus as a training corpus. Another popular method is to use a Chunk
parsing for statistics model to determine the boundary (Koeling, 2000). Chunk parsing was first introduced by Abney (1991), which is one of the most widely used syntactic parsing methods. The main
idea of chunk parsing lies in seeking the appropriate breakthrough point, and decomposing the full
parsing problems into a syntax topology statistical structure and syntactic relations. Zhao and Huang
(1998) are pioneers in Chinese phrase studies; Tsinghua University had also completed its TCT
(Tsinghua Chinese Treebank) for Chinese (Zhou, 2004). The method has been also applied into studies
of other languages, such as Kazakh Base NP recognition (Altenbek et al, 2009), and Uyghur Base VP
Recognition by CRF (Mamatmin et al, 2012).
Maximum Entropy was first introduced to NLP area by Berger et al (1996) and Della Pietra et al.
(1997). Maximum Entropy is an extremely flexible technique for linguistic modelling. It can use a virtually unrestricted and rich feature set in the framework of a probability model. It is a conditional, discriminative model and allows mutually dependent variables (Ratnaparkhi, 1999).

Kazakh Phase Parsing
Kazakh Morphology

Morphological analysis is an important task in natural language processing research. It was developed
for different languages, included English (Porter, 1980), Finnish (Karttunen, 1983), Turkish (Oflazer, 1994; Gülşen, 2004), and Arabic (Beesley, 1996).
Comparing with other languages, the Kazakh morphological system uses a large number of suffixes
and a small number of prefixes. Every word has a root, or a stem (Milat, 2003;Zhang 2004). The basic
Kazakh phrase is an adjacent and non-nested phrase which does not contain recursive structure.
3.2

The Categories of Kazakh Phrase

Parsing is one of the most basic and fundamental components in natural language processing. Chunk
parsing intends to obtain a fragment without thinking deeply.
A Kazakh phrase is composed of two or more than two words which connected with meaning and
grammatical structure. There is only a core word in a Kazakh phrase. In the case of Kazakh, Kazakh
phrases can be divided into fixed phrases and temporary phrases by the meanings of the phrases.
Abney propose the first complete description of lexical chunks system. In this study the basic phrase
chunks base was found according to Abney’s system. The five most common phrase in Kazakh are
NO.

Statistics and Analysis of Kazakh Phrase Structure

Referring to modern Kazakh grammar (Milat, 2003; Dingjing Zhong. 2004), the basic rules of phrase
structure of Kazakh language was summarized. The phrase structures are extracted from the corpus,
and a set of rules are created based on it as well.
In the representation of basic phrase structures, the following part of speech tagging symbols are used
in XML documents of Kazakh corpus: v (verb), n. (noun), adj. (adjective), num. (number), adv. (adverb), pron. (pronoun), ono. (onomatopoeia), int.(interjections), conj. (conjunction), part. (partical).
The Kazakh phrases Structure divided by the function of phrases in our system are shown below.
Kazakh verb phrase structure:
1) n+v; 2) v+v; 3) adv+v; 4) adj+v; 5) v+adv; 6) v+v+v; 7) pron+v; 8) n+part+v; 9) n+conj+v;
10) ono+v; 11) int+v; 12) v+part+v; 13)v+part; 14) v+conj+v; 15)pron+part+v.
Kazakh noun phrase structure:
1) n+n; 2) n+conj+n; 3) pron+conj+pron; 4) pron+n; 5) adj+conj+adj; 6) adj+n; 7) adj+adv+n;
8) num+n; 9) v+n; 10) [ ]+n.
Kazakh adjective phrase structure:
1) adj+n; 2) adj+v; 3) adj+n+v; 4) pron+adj; 5) adv+adj+n; 6) adj+adj+n; 7) num+adv+n;
Collocations, like v+adv, n+part+v, pron+adv, v+part+v, v+part, also exist in other phrase except verb
phrase. These conditions easily cause ambiguity.

Rule-based phrase tagging

Kazakh language has two characteristics that have to be taken into account: agglutinative morphology
and rather free word order with explicit case marking.
The corpus we used in this process has been already segmented. The way we extracted stem and affix
was briefly mentioned in the paper. In this paper we used the segmented results of early work, as it is
not the core part of the algorithm.
Input: word segmentation (extraction stem and affix) and POS tagged corpus (test.xml);
Output: First: Phrase tagged file; Second: Phrase file;
Based on the basic rules of phrase, we have done extraction of phrases from POS tagged Kazakh corpus. The extraction process is as follows:
(a) First roughly segmented XML corpus. The common segmentation marks include semicolon, comma, full stop, exclamation mark, question mark.
(b) For the segmented data, we extract the three elements of basic phrase: part of speech (POS), affix,
and the word.

(c) Look for the matched rule in the rule set. If found, save the basic phrase. Otherwise go back step 1.
According to combination rules of basic Kazakh phrase, basic phrase was extracted from corpus and
modified by manual work. The correct combination of basic Kazakh phrase was marked.

Analysis of Kazakh phrase structure ambiguity

Ambiguity computer analysis of language structure has been one of the difficulties problems. This article from the delimitation ambiguity and structural relationship is to study two aspects of phrase structure ambiguity.
One of the difficulties in Kazakh phrase research is the phrase disambiguation problem. Ambiguous
reasons is word POS ambiguity, phrase boundaries is not easy to determine, POS with the same sequence, E.g. there are five ambiguous forms:
(1) VD form (v + adv )
Eg.1a：
is verb phrase. (Admission to reduce)
Eg.1b：
is adverb phrase. ( Admission to more than)
(2) ND for (n+adv, pron+adv)
Eg.2a：
is verb phrase.( Change a new clothes)
Eg.2b：
is adverb phrase.( Good record)
(3) NPV form（ n+part+v, pron+part+v)
Eg.3a：
is verb phrase.( Learn about unity)
Eg.3b：
is noun phrase.( only Ashan)
(4) VPV form (v+part+v)
Eg.4a：
is verb phrase.( came then left)
Eg.4b：
is adverb phrase. (Relevant research to understand)
(5) VP form (v+part)
Eg.5a：
is verb phrase.( Speaking before)
Eg.5b：
is verb phrase.( Organize the relevant)

For these ambiguities, we can't simply use the rules to match ways to eliminate, but rather to use maximum entropy model to solve the problem.

Kazakh Phrase Identification based Maximum Entropy Model

Maximum Entropy Model is an effective machine learning model which is proposed to solve the POS
tagging problem, it using ME model is the ability to incorporate various features into the conditional
probability. The Kazakh phrase recognition task is presented as follow.
The entropy model P:

H ( p)  x , y p( x, y ) log( x, y )

(1)

Note: X represents the environmental context words to be marked and y is the output.

Maximum Entropy Model： Such a model can be shown to have the following form:
p*  arg max H ( p)

(2)
Goal: select a distribution p from a set of allowed distributions that maximizes H(y|X).

Feature defined

Kazakh language is an agglutinative language with word structures formed by adding derivational,
inflectional affixes or suffixes to root words. The features include words, part of speech (POS), inflectional affixes of the training corpus. It seems that the features are naïve. However, these three kinds of
features are the most important components of Kazakh language, and they reflect the characteristic of
Kazakh language.
According to its own characteristics of a Kazakh, this feature space is defined as follows:
(1) the word, including the current word, the previous word and next word.

1010

(2) part of speech(POS), including the part-of-speech types of the current word, previous word and
next word.
(3) Affix ingredients, including the current word and the word about the additional ingredient infomation.
(4) Phrase tag that contains the current word and the words to the right and the left two words Phrase
marker.
This rule-based approach was applied to generate the maximum entropy model training corpus. Based
on Kazakh linguistics, the atomic feature space is as shown in table 3.

7.2 Feature selection
Basic phrases with statistical model recognition need to select a high correlation, and the Kazakh language features to train with good effect. Establish model based on rule of the language, this work selected feature through templates. After several rounds of experimental debugging, then used artificial
selection, twenty one templates were selected for Kazakh verb phrase, only considered important features. According to each one’s feature, templates were defined as follow.

We selected some corpus from Xinjiang Daily tested on six features above, we got different influences
of different characters. It shows that the C and F template give us the most highest result, namely the
two words on the right have the biggest influence to the result. It proves Kazakh verb phrases are
commonly at the end of the sentence.
7.3

General threshold selection

There are two general feature selection methods: incremental feature selection and feature selection of
based on frequency threshold. The frequency is greater than a threshold value equal to a characteristic.
Through repeating them many times, the frequency threshold value was characterized k = 5, characterized in that the use of the frequency characteristic is greater than 5.

10 Conclusion
This paper provided solution for identifying Kazakh basic phrases. We have tried rule-based and the
maximum entropy methods. The Kazakh words, part of speech, affixes context information are used to
design template of features for maximum entropy model. Based on statistical methods, higher accuracy could be obtained in the test, but it was requires more training data.
The recognition of basic Kazakh phrase could simplify sentence structure, reduce the difficulty of syntactic analyzer. This work put maximum entropy model into recognition of basic Kazakh phrase.
However, there are still space for improvement on scale and accuracy rate comparing to English and
Chinese. In the future, our work will focus on completing of corpus and other models.
