Abstract

represented as a vector in a multi-dimensional continuous space, and a similarity metric such as cosine similarity can be used to measure the relatedness of different items. Vector space representations
have been used both at the document and word levels. At the document level, they are effective for
applications including information retrieval (Salton
and McGill, 1983; Deerwester et al., 1990), document clustering (Deerwester et al., 1990; Xu et al.,
2003), search relevance measurement (Baeza-Yates
and Ribiero-Neto, 1999) and cross-lingual document retrieval (Platt et al., 2010). At the word level,
vector representations have been used to measure
word similarity (Deerwester et al., 1990; Turney and
Littman, 2005; Turney, 2006; Turney, 2001; Lin,
1998; Agirre et al., 2009; Reisinger and Mooney,
2010) and for language modeling (Bellegarda, 2000;
Coccaro and Jurafsky, 1998). While quite successful, these applications have typically been consistent
with a very general notion of similarity in which
basic association is measured, and finer shades of
meaning need not be distinguished. For example,
latent semantic analysis might assign a high degree
of similarity to opposites as well as synonyms (Landauer and Laham, 1998; Landauer, 2002).

Existing vector space models typically map
synonyms and antonyms to similar word vectors, and thus fail to represent antonymy. We
introduce a new vector space representation
where antonyms lie on opposite sides of a
sphere: in the word vector space, synonyms
have cosine similarities close to one, while
antonyms are close to minus one.
We derive this representation with the aid of a
thesaurus and latent semantic analysis (LSA).
Each entry in the thesaurus – a word sense
along with its synonyms and antonyms – is
treated as a “document,” and the resulting document collection is subjected to LSA. The key
contribution of this work is to show how to assign signs to the entries in the co-occurrence
matrix on which LSA operates, so as to induce
a subspace with the desired property.
We evaluate this procedure with the Graduate Record Examination questions of (Mohammed et al., 2008) and find that the method
improves on the results of that study. Further
improvements result from refining the subspace representation with discriminative training, and augmenting the training data with
general newspaper text. Altogether, we improve on the best previous results by 11 points
absolute in F measure.

Introduction

Vector space representations have proven useful
across a wide variety of text processing applications
ranging from document clustering to search relevance measurement. In these applications, text is

Independent of vector-space representations, a
number of authors have focused on identifying different kinds of relatedness. At the simplest level,
we may wish to distinguish between synonyms and
antonyms, which can be further differentiated. For
example, in synonymy, we may wish to distinguish
hyponyms and hypernyms. Moreover, Cruse (1986)
notes that numerous kinds of antonymy are possible,
for example antipodal pairs like “top-bottom” or

gradable opposites like “light-heavy.” Work in this
area includes (Turney, 2001; Lin et al., 2003; Turney and Littman, 2005; Turney, 2006; Curran and
Moens, 2002; van der Plas and Tiedemann, 2006;
Mohammed et al., 2008; Mohammed et al., 2011).
Despite the existence of a large amount of related
work in the literature, distinguishing synonyms and
antonyms is still considered as a difficult open problem in general (Poon and Domingos, 2009).
In this paper, we fuse these two strands of research in an attempt to develop a vector space representation in which the synonymy and antonymy
are naturally differentiated. We follow Schwab et
al. (2002) in requiring a representation in which
two lexical items in an antonymy relation should lie
at opposite ends of an axis. However, in contrast
to the logical axes used previously, we desire that
antonyms should lie at the opposite ends of a sphere
lying in a continuous and automatically induced vector space. To generate this vector space, we present
a novel method for assigning both negative and positive values to the TF-IDF weights used in latent semantic analysis.
To determine these signed values, we exploit the
information present in a thesaurus. The result is a
vector space representation in which synonyms cluster together, and the opposites of a word tend to cluster together at the opposite end of a sphere.
This representation provides several advantages
over the raw thesaurus. First, by finding the items
most and least similar to a word, we are able to discover new synonyms and antonyms. Second, as discussed in Section 5, the representation provides a
natural starting point for gradient-descent based optimization. Thirdly, as we discuss in Section 6, it is
straightforward to embed new words into the derived
subspace by using information from a large unsupervised text corpus such as Wikipedia.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes previous work. Section 3
presents the classical LSA approach and analyzes
some of its limitations. In Section 4 we present our
polarity inducing extension to LSA. Section 5 further extends the approach by optimizing the vector
space representation with supervised discriminative
training. Section 6 describes the proposed method of
embedding new words in the thesaurus-derived subspace. The experimental results of Section 7 indi1213

cate that the proposed method outperforms previous
approaches on a GRE test of closest-opposites (Mohammed et al., 2008). Finally, Section 8 concludes
the paper.

Related Work

The detection of antonymy has been studied in a
number of previous papers. Mohammed et al. (2008)
approach the problem by combining information
from a published thesaurus with corpus statistics derived from the Google n-gram corpus (Brants and
Franz, 2006). Their method consists of two main
steps: first, detecting contrasting word categories
(e.g. “WORK” vs. “ACTIVITY FOR FUN”) and
then determining the degree of antonymy. Categories are defined by a thesaurus; contrasting categories are found by using affix rules (e.g., un- &
dis-) and WordNet antonymy links. Words belonging to contrasting categories are treated as antonyms
and the degree of contrast is determined by distributional similarity. Mohammed et al. (2008) also
provides a publicly available dataset for detection of
antonymy, which we have adopted. This work has
been extended in (Mohammed et al., 2011) to include a study of antonymy based on crowd-sourcing
experiments.
Turney (2008) proposes a unified approach to
handling analogies, synonyms, antonyms and associations by transforming the last three cases into
cases of analogy. A supervised learning method
is then used to solve the resulting analogical problems. This is evaluated on a set of 136 ESL questions. Lin et al. (2003) builds on (Lin, 1998) and
identifies antonyms as semantically related words
which also happen to be found together in a database
in pre-identified phrases indicating opposition. Lin
et al. (2003) further note that whereas synonyms
will tend to translate to the same word in another
language, antonyms will not. This observation is
used to select antonyms from amongst distributionally similar words. Antonymy is used in (de Simone and Kazakov, 2005) for document clustering
and (Harabagiu et al., 2006) to find contradiction.
The automatic detection of synonyms has been
more extensively studied. Lin (1998) presents
a thorough comparison of word-similarity metrics
based on distributional similarity, where this is de-

termined from co-occurrence statistics in dependency triples extracted by parsing a large dataset.
Related studies are described in (Curran and Moens,
2002; van der Plas and Bouma, 2005). Later, van
der Plas and Tiedemann (2006) extend the use of
multilingual data present in Lin et al. (2003) by measuring distributional similarity based on the contexts
that a word occurs in once translated into a new language. This is used to improve the precision/recall
characteristics on synonym pairs. Structured information can be important in determining relatedness,
and thesauri and Wikipedia links have been studied
in (Milne and Witten, 2008; Jarmasz and Szpakowicz, 2003). Combinations of approaches are studied
in (Turney et al., 2003).
Vector-space models and latent semantic analysis
in particular have a long history of use in synonym
detection, which in fact was suggested in some of
the earliest LSA papers. Deerwester et al. (1990)
defines a metric for measuring word similarity based
on LSA, and it has been used in (Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Landauer et al., 1998) to answer word
similarity questions derived from the Test of English
as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Turney (2001)
proposes the use of point-wise mutual information in
conjunction with LSA, and again presents results on
synonym questions derived from the TOEFL. Variants of vector space models are further analyzed
in (Turney and Littman, 2005; Turney, 2006; Turney and Pantel, 2010).

Latent Semantic Analysis

Latent Semantic Analysis (Deerwester et al., 1990)
is a widely used method for representing words and
documents in a low dimensional vector space. The
method is based on applying singular value decomposition (SVD) to a matrix W which indicates the
occurrence of words in documents. To perform
LSA, one proceeds as follows. The input is a collection of d documents which are expressed in terms
of words from a vocabulary of size n. These documents may be actual documents such as newspaper
articles, or simply notional documents such as sentences, or any other collection in which words are
grouped together. Next, a d × n document-term ma1214

trix W is formed1 . At its simplest form, the ij th
entry contains the number of times word j has occurred in document i – its term frequency or TF
value. More conventionally, the entry is weighted
by some notion of the importance of word j, for example the negative logarithm of the fraction of documents that contain it, resulting in a TF-IDF weighting (Salton et al., 1975). The similarity between two
documents can be computed using the cosine similarity of their corresponding row vectors:
x·y
sim(x, y) =
k x kk y k
Similarly, the cosine similarity of two column vectors can be used to judge the similarity of the corresponding words. Finally, to obtain a subspace representation of dimension k, W is decomposed as
W ≈ U SV T
where U is d × k, V T is k × n, and S is a k × k
diagonal matrix. In applications, k  n and k  d;
for example one might have a 50, 000 word vocabulary and 1, 000, 000 documents and use a 300 dimensional subspace representation.
An important property of SVD is that the columns
of SV T – which now represent the words – behave
similarly to the original columns of W , in the sense
that the cosine similarity between two columns in
SV T approximates the cosine similarity between the
corresponding columns in W . This follows from
the observation that W T W = V S 2 V T , and the fact
that the ij th entry of W T W is the dot product of
the ith and j th columns (words) in W . We will
use this observation subsequently in the derivation
of polarity-inducing LSA. For efficiency, we normalize the columns of SV T to unit length, allowing the cosine similarity between two words to be
computed with a single dot-product; this also has the
property of mapping each word to a point on a multidimensional sphere.
A second important property of LSA is that in the
word representations which result can by viewed as
the result of applying a projection matrix U to the
original vectors as:
U T W = SV T
1
(Bellegarda, 2000) constructs the transpose of this, but we
have found it convenient in data processing for documents to
represent rows.

In Section 5, we will view U simply as a d×k matrix
learned through gradient descent so as to optimize
an objective function.
3.1

Limitation of LSA

Word similarity as determined by LSA assigns high
values to words which tend to co-occur in documents. However, as noted by (Landauer and
Laham, 1998; Landauer, 2002), there is no notion of antonymy; words with low or negative cosine scores are simply unrelated. In comparison,
words with high cosine similarity scores are typically semantically related, which includes both synonyms and antonyms, as contrasting words often cooccur (Murphy and Andrew, 1993; Mohammed et
al., 2008). To illustrate this, we have performed
SVD with the aid of the Encarta thesaurus developed
by Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. This thesaurus contains approximately 47k word senses and a vocabulary of 50k words and phrases. Each “document”
is taken to be the thesaurus entry for a word-sense,
including synonyms and antonyms. For example,
the word “admirable” induces a document consisting of {admirable, estimable, commendable, venerable, good, splendid, worthy, marvelous, excellent,
unworthy}. Note that the last word in this set is its
antonym. Performing SVD on this set of thesaurus
derived “meaning-documents” results in a subspace
representation for each word. This form of LSA is
similar to the use of Wikipedia in (Gabrilovich and
Markovitch, 2007).
Table 1 shows some words, their original thesaurus documents, and the most and least similar
words in the LSA subspace. Several properties are
apparent:
• The vector-space representation of words is
able to identify related words that are not explicitly present in the original thesaurus. For
example, “meritorious” for “admirable” – arguably better than any of the words given in the
thesaurus itself.
• Similarity is based on co-occurrence, so the
co-occurrence of antonyms in the thesaurusderived documents induces their presence as
LSA-similar words.
For example, “contemptible” is identified as similar to “admirable.” In the case of “mourning,” opposites

such as “joy” and “elation” actually dominate
the list of LSA-similar words.
• The LSA-least-similar words have no relationship at all to the word they are least-similar to.
For example, the least-similar word to “considered” is “ready-made-meal.”
In the next section, we will present a method for
inducing polarity in LSA subspaces, where opposite
words will tend to have negative cosine similarities,
analogous to the positive similarities of synonyms.
Thus, the least-similar words to a given word will be
its opposites.

Polarity Inducing LSA

We modify LSA so that we may exploit a thesaurus
to embed meaningful axes in the induced subspace
representation. Words with opposite meaning will
lie at opposite positions on a sphere. Recall that the
cosine similarity between word-vectors in the original matrix W are preserved in the subspace representation of words. Thus, if we construct the original
matrix so that the columns representing antonyms
will tend to have negative cosine similarities while
columns representing synonyms will tend to have
positive similarities, we will achieve the desired behavior.
This can be achieved by negating the TF-IDF entries for the antonyms of a word when constructing
W from the thesaurus, which is illustrated in Tables 2 and 3. The two rows in these tables correspond to thesaurus entries for the sense-categories

“acrimony,” and “affection.” The thesaurus entries
induce two “documents” containing the words and
their synonyms and antonyms. The complete set of
words is acrimony, rancor, goodwill, affection. For
simplicity, we assume that all TF-IDF weights are
1. In the original LSA formulation, we have the representation of Table 2. “Rancor” is listed as a synonym of “acrimony,” which has “goodwill” and “affection” as its antonyms. This results in the first row.
Note that the cosine similarity between every pair of
words (columns) is 1.
Table 3 shows the polarity-inducing representation. Here, the cosine similarity between synonymous words (columns) is 1, and the cosine similarity
between antonymous words is -1. Since LSA tends
to preserve cosine similarities between words, in the
resulting subspace we may expect to find meaningful axes, where opposite senses map to opposite extremes. We refer to this as polarity-inducing LSA or
PILSA.
In Table 4, we show the PILSA-similar and
PILSA-least-similar words for the same words as in
Table 1. We see now that words which are least
similar in the sense of having the lowest cosinesimilarity are indeed opposites. In this table generally the most similar words have similarities in the
range of 0.7 to 1.0 and the least similar in the range
of -0.7 to -1.0.

Discriminative Training

Although the cosine similarity of LSA-derived word
vectors are generally very effective in applications
such as judging the relevance of words or documents, or detecting antonyms as in our construction,
the process of singular value decomposition in LSA
does not explicitly try to achieve such goals. In this
section, we see that when supervised training data is
available, the projection matrix of LSA can be enhanced through a discriminative training technique
explicitly designed to create a representation suited
to a specific task.
Because LSA is closely related to principle component analysis (PCA), extensions of PCA such as
canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and oriented
principle component analysis (OPCA) can leverage
the labeled data and produce the projection matrix
through general eigen-decomposition (Platt et al.,
2010). Along this line of work, Yih et al. (2011)
proposed a Siamese neural network approach called
S2Net, which tunes the projection matrix directly
through gradient descent, and has shown to outperform other methods in several tasks. Below we describe briefly this technique and explain how we
adopt it for the task of antonym detection.
The goal of S2Net is to learn a concept vector
representation of the original sparse term vectors.
Although such transformation can be non-linear in
general, its current design chooses the model form
to be a linear projection matrix, which is identical to

that of LSA, PCA, OPCA or CCA. Given a d-by-1
input vector f , the model of S2Net is a d-by-k matrix A = [aij ]d×k , which maps f to a k-by-1 output
vector g = AT f . The fact that the transformation
can be viewed as a two-layer neural network leads
to the method’s name.
What differentiates S2Net from other approaches
is its loss function and optimization process. In
the “parallel text” setting, the labeled data consists of pairs of similar text objects such as documents. The objective of the training process is
to assign higher cosine similarities to these pairs
compared to others. More specifically, suppose the
training set consists of m pairs of raw input vectors
{(fp1 , fq1 ), (fp2 , fq2 ), · · · , (fpm , fqm )}. Given a projection matrix A, the similarity score of any pair of
objects is simA (fpi , fqj ) = cosine(AT fpi , AT fqj ).
Let ∆ij = simA (fpi , fqi ) − simA (fpi , fqj ) be the
difference of the similarity scores of (fpi , fqi ) and
(fpi , fqj ). The learning procedure tries to increase
∆ij by using the following logistic loss:
L(∆ij ; A) = log(1 + exp(−γ∆ij )),
where γ is a scaling factor that adjusts the loss function2 . The loss of the whole training set is thus:
1
m(m − 1)

X

by standard gradient-based methods, such as LBFGS (Nocedal and Wright, 2006).
The original setting of S2Net can be directly applied to finding synonymous words, where the training data consists of pairs of vectors representing
two synonyms. It is also easy to modify the loss
function to apply it to the antonym detection problem. We first sample pairs of antonyms from the
thesaurus to create the training data. The raw input
vector f of a selected word is its corresponding column vector of the document-term matrix W (Section 3) after inducing polarity (Section 4). When
each pair of vectors in the training data represents
two antonyms, we can redefine ∆ij by flipping the
sign: ∆ij = simA (fpi , fqj ) − simA (fpi , fqi ), and
leave others unchanged. As the loss function encourages ∆ij to be larger, an antonym pair will tend to
have a smaller cosine similarity than other pairs. Because S2Net uses a gradient descent technique and a
non-convex objective function, it is sensitive to initialization, and we have found that the PILSA projection matrix U (Section 3) provides an excellent
starting point. As illustrated in Section 7, learning
the word vectors with S2Net produces a significant
improvement over PILSA alone.

1217

While PILSA is effective at representing synonym
and antonym information, in its pure form, it is limited to the vocabulary of the thesaurus. In order to
extend PILSA to operate on out-of-thesaurus words,

we employ a two-stage strategy. We first conduct
some lexical analysis and try to match an unknown
word to one or more in-thesaurus words in their lemmatized forms. If no such match can be found,
we then attempt to find semantically related inthesaurus words by leveraging co-occurrence statistics from general text data. These two steps are described in detail below.
6.1

Matching via Lexical Analysis

When a target word is not included in a thesaurus, it
is quite often that some of its morphological variations are covered. For example, although the Encarta
thesaurus does not have the word “corruptibility,”
it does contain other forms like “corruptible” and
“corruption.” Replacing the out-of-thesaurus target
word with these morphological variations may alter
the part-of-speech but typically does not change the
meaning3 .
Given an out-of-thesaurus target word, we first
apply a morphological analyzer for English developed by Minnen et al. (2001), which removes the
inflectional affixes and returns the lemma. If the
lemma still does not exist in the thesaurus, we then
apply Porter’s stemmer (Porter, 1980) and check
whether the target word can match any of the inthesaurus words in their stemmed forms. A simple rule that checks whether removing hyphens from
words can lead to a match and whether the target
word occurs as part of a compound word in the thesaurus is applied when both morphological analysis
and stemming fail to find a match. When there are
more than one matched words, the centroid of their
PILSA vectors is used to represent the target word.
When there is only one matched word, the matched
word is treated as the target word.
6.2

Leveraging General Text Data

If no words in the thesaurus can be linked to the
target word through the simple lexical analysis procedure, we try to find matched words by creating
a context vector space model from a large document collection, and then mapping from this space
to the PILSA space. We use contexts because of the
distributional hypothesis – words that occur in the
same contexts tend to have similar meaning (Harris,
3

The rules we use based on lexical analysis are moderately
conservative to avoid mistakes like mapping hopeless to hope.

1218

1954). When a word is not in the thesaurus but appears in the corpus, we predict its PILSA vector representation from the context vector space model by
using its k-nearest neighbors which are in the thesaurus and consistent with each other.
6.2.1

Context Vector Space Model

Given a corpus of documents, we construct the
raw context vectors as follows. For each target word,
we first create a bag of words by collecting all the
terms within a window of [-10,+10] centered at each
occurrence of the target word in the corpus. The
non-identical terms form a term-vector, where each
term is weighted using its TF-IDF value. We then
perform LSA on the context-word matrix. The semantic similarity/relatedness of two words can then
be determined using the cosine similarity of their
corresponding LSA word vectors. In the following
text, we refer to this LSA context vector space model
as the corpus space, in contrast to the PILSA thesaurus space.
6.2.2

Embedding Out-of-Vocabulary Words

Given the context space model, we may use a
linear regression or a k-nearest neighbors approach
to embed out-of-thesaurus words into the thesaurusspace representation. However, as near words in the
context space may be synonyms in addition to other
semantically related words (including antonyms),
such approaches can potentially be noisy. For example, words like “hot” and “cold” may be close
to each other in the context space due to their similar usage in text. An affine transform cannot “tear
space” and map them to opposite poles in the thesaurus space.
Therefore, we propose a revised k-nearest neighbors approach. Suppose we are interested in an outof-thesaurus word w. We first find K-nearest inthesaurus neighbors to w in the context space. We
then select a subset of k members of these K words
such that the pairwise similarity of each of the k
members with every other member is positive. The
thesaurus-space centroid of these k items is computed as w’s representation. This procedure has the
property that the k nearby words used to form the
embedding of a non-thesaurus word are selected to
be consistent with each other. In practice, we used
K = 10 and k = 3, which requires only around

1000 pairwise computations even done in a bruteforce way. To provide a concrete example, if we
had the out-of-thesaurus word “sweltering” with inthesaurus neighbors “hot, cold, burning, scorching,
...” the procedure would return the centroid of “hot,
burning, scorching” and exclude “cold.”

Experimental Validation

In this section, we present our experimental results
on applying PILSA and its extensions to answering
the closest-opposite GRE questions.
7.1

Data Resources

The primary thesaurus we use is the Encarta Thesaurus developed by Bloomsbury Publishing Plc4 .
Our version of this has approximately 47k word
senses and a vocabulary of 50k words, and contains 125,724 pairs of antonyms. To experiment with
the effect of using a different thesaurus, we used
WordNet as an information source. Each synset in
WordNet maps to a row in the document-term matrix; synonyms in a synset are weighted with positive TFIDF values, and antonyms are weighted negative TFIDF values. Entries corresponding to other
words in the vocabulary are 0. WordNet provides
significantly greater coverage with approximately
227k synsets involving multiple words, and a vocabulary of about 190k words. However, it is also
much sparser, with 5.3 words per sense on average
as opposed to 10.3 in the thesaurus, and has only
62,821 pairs of antonyms. As general text data for
use in embedding out-of-vocabulary words, we used
a Nov-2010 dump of English Wikipedia, which contains approximately 917M words.
7.2

Development and Test Data

For testing, we use the closest-opposite questions
from GRE tests provided by (Mohammed et al.,
2008). Each question contains a target word and
five choices, and asks which of the choice words has
the most opposite meaning to the target word. Two
datasets are made publicly available by Mohammad
et al. (2008): the development set, which consists of
162 questions, and the test set, which has 950 questions5 . We considered making our own, more exten4

Table 5: The performance of PILSA vs. the number of dimensions when applied to the closest-opposite questions
from the GRE development set. Out of the 162 questions, using the Bloomsbury thesaurus data we are able
to answer 153 of them. Using 300 dimensions gives the
best precision (132/153 = 0.863). This dimension setting is also optimal when using the WordNet data, which
answers 100 questions correctly out of the 160 attempts
(100/160 = 0.625).

sive, test – for example one which would require the
use of sentence context to choose between related
yet distributionally different antonyms (e.g. “little,
small” as antonyms of “big”) but chose to stick to a
previously used benchmark. This allows the direct
comparison with previously reported methods.
Some of these questions contain very rarely used
target or choice words, which are not included in
the thesaurus vocabulary. In order to provide a fair
comparison to existing methods, we do not try to
randomly answer these questions. Instead, when the
target word is out of vocabulary, we skip the whole
question. When the target word is in vocabulary but
one or more choices are unknown words, we ignore
those unknown words and pick the word with the
lowest cosine similarity from the rest as the answer.
The results of our methods are reported in precision
(the number of questions answered correctly divided
by the number of questions attempted), recall (the
number of questions answered correctly divided by
the number of all questions) and F1 (the harmonic
mean of precision and recall)6 . We now turn to an
in-depth evaluation.

Precision/recall/F1 were used in (Mohammed et al., 2008)
as when their system “did not find any evidence of antonymy
between the target and any of its alternatives, then it refrained
from attempting that question.” We adopt this convention to
provide a fair comparison to their system.

Basic PILSA

When applying PILSA, we need to determine the
number of dimensions in the projected space. Evaluated on the GRE development set, Table 5 shows
the precision of PILSA, using two different training
datasets, Bloomsbury and WordNet, at different dimensions.
The Bloomsbury-based system is able to answer
153 questions, and the best dimension setting is
300, which answers 132 questions correctly and thus
archives 0.863 in precision. In contrast, the larger
vocabulary in WordNet helps the system answer 160
questions but the quality is not as good. We find
dimensions 300 and 400 are equally good, where
both answer 100 questions correctly (0.625 in precision)7 . Because a lower number of dimensions
is preferred for saving storage space and computing
time, we choose 300 as the number of dimensions in
PILSA.
We now compare the proposed methods. All results are summarized in Table 6. When evaluated on
the GRE test set, the Bloomsbury thesaurus-based
methods (Lines 4–7) attempted 865 questions. The
precision, recall and F1 of the Bloomsbury-based
PILSA model (Line 6) are 0.81, 0.74 and 0.77,
which are all better than the best reported method
in (Mohammed et al., 2008)8 . In contrast, the
WordNet-based methods (Lines 1–3) attempted 936

questions. However, consistent with what we observed on the development set, the WordNet-based
model is inferior. Its precision, recall and F1 on
the test set are 0.60, 0.60 and 0.60 (Line 3). Although the quality of the data source plays an important role, we need to emphasize that performing
LSA using our polarity inducing construction is in
fact a critical step in enhancing the model performance. For example, directly using the antonym sets
in the Bloomsbury thesaurus gives 0.59 in F1 (Line
4), while using cosine similarity on the signed vectors prior to LSA only reaches 0.60 in F1 (Line 5).
7.4

Improving Precision with Discriminative
Training

Building on the success of the unsupervised PILSA
model, we refine the projection matrix. As described
in Section 5, we take the PILSA projection matrix
as the initial model in S2Net and train the model
using 20,517 pairs of antonyms sampled from the
Bloomsbury thesaurus. A separate sample of 5,000
antonym pairs is used as the validation set for hyperparameter tuning in regularization. Encouragingly,
we found that the already strong results of PILSA
can indeed be improved, which gives 3 more points
in both precision (0.84), recall (0.77) and F1 (0.80).
7.5

Improving Recall with Unsupervised Data

We next evaluate our approach of extending the
word coverage with the help of an external text corpus, as well as the lexical analysis procedure. Using
the Bloomsbury PILSA-S2Net thesaurus space and
the Wikipedia corpus space, our method increases

recall by 3 points on the test set. Compared to the invocabulary only setting, it attempted 75 more questions (865 → 940) and had 33 of them correctly answered.
While the accuracy on these questions is much
higher than random, the fact that it is substantially
below the precision of the original indicates some
room for improvement. We notice that the out-ofthesaurus words are either offensive words excluded
in the thesaurus (e.g., moronic) or some very rarely
used words (e.g., froward). When the lexical analysis procedure fails to match the target word to some
in-thesaurus words, the context vector embedding
approach solves the former case, but has difficulty
in handling the latter. The main reason is that such
words occur very infrequently in a general corpus,
which result in significant uncertainty in their semantic vectors. Other than using a much larger
corpus, approaches that leverage character n-grams
may help. We leave this as future work.

Conclusion

In this paper we have tackled the problem of finding a vector-space representation of words where,
by construction, synonyms and antonyms are easy
to distinguish. Specifically, we have defined a way
of assigning sign to the entries in the co-occurrence
matrix on which LSA operates, such that synonyms
will tend to have positive cosine similarity, and
antonyms will tend to have negative similarities. To
the best of our knowledge, our method of inducing
polarity to the document-term matrix before applying LSA is novel and has shown to effectively preserve and generalize the synonymous/antonymous
information in the projected space. With this vector
space representation, we were able to bring to bear
the machinery of discriminative training in order to
further optimize the word representations. Finally,
by using the notion of closeness in this space, we
were able to embed new out-of-vocabulary words
into the space. On a standard test set, the proposed
methods improved the F measure by 11 points absolute over previous results.
