Abstract

Question:
What vehicle is pictured?

Visual question answering (Visual QA) has attracted a lot of attention lately, seen essentially
as a form of (visual) Turing test that artificial
intelligence should strive to achieve. In this
paper, we study a crucial component of this
task: how can we design good datasets for
the task? We focus on the design of multiplechoice based datasets where the learner has to
select the right answer from a set of candidate ones including the target (i.e. the correct
one) and the decoys (i.e. the incorrect ones).
Through careful analysis of the results attained
by state-of-the-art learning models and human
annotators on existing datasets, we show that
the design of the decoy answers has a significant impact on how and what the learning models learn from the datasets. In particular, the resulting learner can ignore the visual information, the question, or both while
still doing well on the task. Inspired by this,
we propose automatic procedures to remedy
such design deficiencies. We apply the procedures to re-construct decoy answers for two
popular Visual QA datasets as well as to create a new Visual QA dataset from the Visual Genome project, resulting in the largest
dataset for this task. Extensive empirical studies show that the design deficiencies have been
alleviated in the remedied datasets and the
performance on them is likely a more faithful indicator of the difference among learning models. The datasets are released and
publicly available via http://www.teds.

In the original dataset, the correct answer “A train” is
easily selected by a machine as it is far often used as
the correct answer than the other decoy (negative) answers. (The numbers in the brackets are probability
scores computed using eq. (2)). Our two procedures —
QoU and IoU (cf. Sect. 4) — create alternative decoys
such that both the correct answer and the decoys are
highly likely by examining either the image or the question alone. In these cases, machines make mistakes unless they consider all information together. Thus, the
alternative decoys suggested our procedures are better
designed to gauge how well a learning algorithm can
understand all information equally well.

gained a lot of attention recently. A number of significant advances in learning algorithms have been
made, along with the development of nearly two
dozens of datasets in this very active research domain. Among those datasets, popular ones include
MSCOCO (Lin et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2015), Visual Genome (Krishna et al., 2017), VQA (Antol
et al., 2015), and several others. The overarching objective is that a learning machine needs to
go beyond understanding different modalities of
information separately (such as image recognition
alone) and to learn how to correlate them in order
to perform well on those tasks.

Introduction

Multimodal information processing tasks such as
image captioning (Farhadi et al., 2010; Ordonez
et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2015) and visual question
answering (Visual QA) (Antol et al., 2015) have

for creating decoy answers. In light of the amount
of human efforts in curating existing datasets for
the Visual QA task, we propose two procedures
that revise those datasets such that the decoy answers are better designed. In contrast to some
earlier works, the procedures are fully automatic
and do not incur additional human annotator efforts. We apply the procedures to revise both Visual7W (Zhu et al., 2016) and VQA (Antol et al.,
2015). Additionally, we create new multiplechoice based datasets from COCOQA (Ren et al.,
2015) and the recently released VQA2 (Goyal
et al., 2017) and Visual Genome datasets (Krishna
et al., 2017). The one based on Visual Genome
becomes the largest multiple-choice dataset for
the Visual QA task, with more than one million
image-question-candidate answers triplets.
We conduct extensive empirical and human
studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our procedures in creating high-quality datasets for the
Visual QA task. In particular, we show that machines need to use all three information (image,
questions and answers) to perform well — any
missing information induces a large drop in performance. Furthermore, we show that humans
dominate machines in the task. However, given
the revised datasets are likely reflecting the true
gap between the human and the machine understanding of multimodal information, we expect
that advances in learning algorithms likely focus
more on the task itself instead of overfitting to the
idiosyncrasies in the datasets.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
In Sect. 2, we describe related work. In Sect. 3,
we analyze and discuss the design deficiencies in
existing datasets. In Sect. 4, we describe our automatic procedures for remedying those deficiencies. In Sect. 5 we conduct experiments and analysis. We conclude the paper in Sect. 6.

To evaluate the progress on those complex and
more AI-like tasks is however a challenging topic.
For tasks involving language generation, developing an automatic evaluation metric is itself an open
problem (Anderson et al., 2016; Kilickaya et al.,
2017; Liu et al., 2016; Kafle and Kanan, 2017b).
Thus, many efforts have concentrated on tasks
such as multiple-choice Visual QA (Antol et al.,
2015; Zhu et al., 2016; Jabri et al., 2016) or selecting the best caption (Hodosh et al., 2013; Hodosh
and Hockenmaier, 2016; Ding et al., 2016; Lin and
Parikh, 2016), where the selection accuracy is a
natural evaluation metric.
In this paper, we study how to design highquality multiple choices for the Visual QA task.
In this task, the machine (or the human annotator)
is presented with an image, a question and a list of
candidate answers. The goal is to select the correct
answer through a consistent understanding of the
image, the question and each of the candidate answers. As in any multiple-choice based tests (such
as GRE), designing what should be presented as
negative answers — we refer them as decoys — is
as important as deciding the questions to ask. We
all have had the experience of exploiting the elimination strategy: This question is easy — none of
the three answers could be right so the remaining
one must be correct!
While a clever strategy for taking exams, such
“shortcuts” prevent us from studying faithfully
how different learning algorithms comprehend the
meanings in images and languages (e.g., the quality of the embeddings of both images and languages in a semantic space). It has been noted
that machines can achieve very high accuracies of
selecting the correct answer without the visual input (i.e., the image), the question, or both (Jabri
et al., 2016; Antol et al., 2015). Clearly, the learning algorithms have overfit on incidental statistics
in the datasets. For instance, if the decoy answers
have rarely been used as the correct answers (to
any questions), then the machine can rule out a decoy answer with a binary classifier that determines
whether the answers are in the set of the correct
answers — note that this classifier does not need
to examine the image and it just needs to memorize the list of the correct answers in the training
dataset. See Fig. 1 for an example, and Sect. 3 for
more and detailed analysis.

Related Work

Wu et al. (2017) and Kafle and Kanan (2017b)
provide recent overviews of the status quo of the
Visual QA task. There are about two dozens of
datasets for the task. Most of them use real-world
images, while some are based on synthetic ones.
Usually, for each image, multiple questions and
their corresponding answers are generated. This
can be achieved either by human annotators, or
with an automatic procedure that uses captions
or question templates and detailed image annota-

We focus on minimizing the impacts of exploiting such shortcuts. We suggest a set of principles

ways to generate decoys for the tasks of multiplechoice visual captioning and dialog, respectively.
Recently, Lin and Parikh (2017) study active
learning for Visual QA: i.e., how to select informative image-question pairs (for acquiring annotations) or image-question-answer triplets for machines to “learn” from. On the other hand, our
work further focuses on designing better datasets
for “evaluating” a machine.

tions. We concentrate on 3 datasets: VQA (Antol
et al., 2015), Visual7W (Zhu et al., 2016), and Visual Genome (Krishna et al., 2017). All of them
use images from MSCOCO (Lin et al., 2014).
Besides the pairs of questions and correct answers, VQA, Visual7W, and visual Madlibs (Yu
et al., 2015) provide decoy answers for each pair
so that the task can be evaluated in multiple-choice
selection accuracy. What decoy answers to use is
the focus of our work.
In VQA, the decoys consist of human-generated
plausible answers as well as high-frequency and
random answers from the datasets. In Visual7W,
the decoys are all human-generated plausible ones.
Note that, humans generate those decoys by only
looking at the questions and the correct answers
but not the images. Thus, the decoys might be unrelated to the corresponding images. A learning
algorithm can potentially examine the image alone
and be able to identify the correct answer.
In visual Madlibs, the questions are generated
with a limited set of question templates and the
detailed annotations (e.g., objects) of the images.
Thus, similarly, a learning model can examine the
image alone and deduce the correct answer.
We propose automatic procedures to revise VQA and Visual7W (and to create new
datasets based on COCOQA (Ren et al., 2015),
VQA2 (Goyal et al., 2017), and Visual Genome)
such that the decoy generation is carefully orchestrated to prevent learning algorithms from exploiting the shortcuts in the datasets by overfitting on
incidental statistics. In particular, our design goal
is that a learning machine needs to understand all
the 3 components of an image-question-candidate
answers triplet in order to make the right choice —
ignoring either one or two components will result
in drastic degradation in performance.
Our work is inspired by the experiments
in (Jabri et al., 2016) where they observe that machines without looking at images or questions can
still perform well on the Visual QA task. Others have also reported similar issues (Goyal et al.,
2017; Zhang et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2017;
Agrawal et al., 2016; Kafle and Kanan, 2017a;
Agrawal et al., 2018), though not in the multiplechoice setting. Our work extends theirs by providing more detailed analysis as well as automatic
procedures to remedy those design deficiencies.
Besides Visual QA, VisDial (Das et al., 2017)
and Ding et al. (2016) also propose automatic

Analysis of Decoy Answers’ Effects

In this section, we examine in detail the dataset
Visual7W (Zhu et al., 2016), a popular choice for
the Visual QA task. We demonstrate how the deficiencies in designing decoy questions impact the
performance of learning algorithms.
In multiple-choice Visual QA datasets, a training or test example is a triplet that consists of
an image I, a question Q, and a candidate answer set A. The set A contains a target T (the
correct answer) and K decoys (incorrect answers)
denoted by D. An IQA triplet is thus {I, Q, A =
{T, D1 , · · · , DK }}. We use C to denote either the
target or a decoy.
3.1

Visual QA models

We investigate how well a learning algorithm can
perform when supplied with different modalities
of information. We concentrate on the one hiddenlayer MLP model proposed in (Jabri et al., 2016),
which has achieved state-of-the-art results on the
dataset Visual7W. The model computes a scoring
function f (c, i)
f (c, i) = σ(U max(0, W g(c, i)) + b)

(1)

over a candidate answer c and the multimodal information i, where g is the joint feature of (c, i)
and σ(x) = 1/(1 + exp(−x)). The information i
can be null, the image (I) alone, the question (Q)
alone, or the combination of both (I+Q).
Given an IQA triplet, we use the penultimate
layer of ResNet-200 (He et al., 2016) as visual features to represent I and the average WORD 2 VEC
embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013) as text features
to represent Q and C. To form the joint feature
g(c, i), we just concatenate the features together.
The candidate c ∈ A that has the highest f (c, i)
score in prediction is selected as the model output.
We use the standard training, validation, and
test splits of Visual7W, where each contains
69,817, 28,020, and 42,031 examples respectively.

chine and human on “I+A” are likely due to their
difference in understanding visual information.
Note that human improves significantly from
“I+A” to “I+Q+A” with “Q” added, while the machine does so only marginally. The difference can
be attributed to the difference in understanding the
question and correlating with the answers between
the two. Since each image corresponds to multiple
questions or have multiple objects, solely relying
on the image itself will not work well in principle.
Such difference clearly indicates that in the Visual
QA model, the language component is weak as
the model cannot fully exploit the information in
“Q”, making a smaller relative improvement 5.3%
(from 62.4% to 65.7%) where humans improved
relatively 17.4%.

Analysis results

Machines find shortcuts Table 1 summarizes
the performance of the learning models, together
with the human studies we performed on a subset
of 1,000 triplets (c.f. Sect. 5 for details). There are
a few interesting observations.
First, in the row of “A” where only the candidate
answers (and whether they are right or wrong) are
used to train a learning model, the model performs
significantly better than random guessing and humans (52.9% vs. 25%) — humans will deem each
of the answers equally likely without looking at
both the image and the question! Note that in this
case, the information i in eq. (1) contains nothing.
The model learns the specific statistics of the candidate answers in the dataset and exploits those.
Adding the information about the image (i.e., the
row of “I+A”), the machine improves significantly
and gets close to the performance when all information is used (62.4% vs. 65.7%). There is a
weaker correlation between the question and the
answers as “Q+A” improves over “A” only modestly. This is expected. In the Visual7W dataset,
the decoys are generated by human annotators as
plausible answers to the questions without being
shown the images — thus, many decoy answers do
not have visual groundings. For instance, a question of “what animal is running?” elicits equally
likely answers such as “dog”, “tiger”, “lion”, or
“cat”, while an image of a dog running in the park
will immediately rule out all 3 but the “dog”, see
Fig. 1 for a similar example. Thus, the performance of “I+A” implies that many IQA triplets
can be solved by object, attribute or concept detection on the image, without understanding the questions. This is indeed the case also for humans —
humans can achieve 75.3% by considering “I+A”
and not “Q”. Note that the difference between ma-

Shortcuts are due to design deficiencies We
probe deeper on how the decoy answers have impacted the performance of learning models.
As explained above, the decoys are drawn from
all plausible answers to a question, irrespective of
whether they are visually grounded or not. We
have also discovered that the targets (i.e., correct
answers) are infrequently used as decoys.
Specifically, among the 69,817 training samples, there are 19,503 unique correct answers and
each one of them is used about 3.6 times as correct answers to a question. However, among all the
69, 817 × 3 ≈ 210K decoys, each correct answer
appears 7.2 times on average, far below a chance
level of 10.7 times (210K ÷ 19, 503 ≈ 10.7). This
disparity exists in the test samples too. Consequently, the following rule, computing each answer’s likelihood of being correct,
P (correct|C) =
(
0.5,

if C is never seen in training,
otherwise,

# times C as target
# times C as target+(# times C as decoys)/K ,

(2)
should perform well. Essentially, it measures how
unbiased C is used as the target and the decoys. Indeed, it attains an accuracy of 48.73% on the test
data, far better than the random guess and is close
to the learning model using the answers’ information only (the “A” row in Table 1).
Good rules for designing decoys Based on our
analysis, we summarize the following guidance
rules to design decoys: (1) Question only Unresolvable (QoU). The decoys need to be equally
434

plausible to the question. Otherwise, machines
can rely on the correlation between the question
and candidate answers to tell the target from decoys, even without the images. Note that this is a
principle that is being followed by most datasets.
(2) Neutrality. The decoys answers should be
equally likely used as the correct answers. (3) Image only Unresolvable (IoU). The decoys need to
be plausible to the image. That is, they should appear in the image, or there exist questions so that
the decoys can be treated as targets to the image.
Otherwise, Visual QA can be resolved by objects,
attributes, or concepts detection in images, even
without the questions.
Ideally, each decoy in an IQA triplet should
meet the three principles. Neutrality is comparably easier to achieve by reusing terms in the whole
set of targets as decoys. On the contrary, a decoy
may hardly meet QoU and IoU simultaneously1 .
However, as long as all decoys of an IQA triplet
meet Neutrality and some meet QoU and others
meet IoU, the triplet as a whole still achieves the
three principles — a machine ignoring either images or questions will likely perform poorly.

plausible for the question Q, QoU-decoys likely
follow the rules of Neutrality and Question
only Unresolvable (QoU). We compute the average WORD 2 VEC (Mikolov et al., 2013) to represent a question, and use the cosine similarity
to measure the similarity between questions.
• IoU-decoys. We collect the targets from other
triplets of the same image to be the decoys for T.
The resulting decoys thus definitely follow the
rules of Neutrality and Image only Unresolvable (IoU).
We then combine the triplet (I, Q, T) with QoUdecoys and IoU-decoys to form an IQA triplet as a
training or test sample.
Resolving ambiguous decoys One potential
drawback of automatically selected decoys is that
they may be semantically similar, ambiguous, or
rephrased terms to the target (Zhu et al., 2016).
We utilize two filtering steps to alleviate it. First,
we perform string matching between a decoy and
the target, deleting those decoys that contain or are
covered by the target (e.g., “daytime” vs. “during
the daytime” and “ponytail” vs. “pony tail”).
Secondly, we utilize the WordNet hierarchy and
the Wu-Palmer (WUP) score (Wu and Palmer,
1994) to eliminate semantically similar decoys.
The WUP score measures how similar two word
senses are (in the range of [0, 1]), based on the
depth of them in the taxonomy and that of their
least common subsumer. We compute the similarity of two strings according to the WUP scores in
a similar manner to (Malinowski and Fritz, 2014),
in which the WUP score is used to evaluate Visual
QA performance. We eliminate decoys that have
higher WUP-based similarity to the target. We use
the NLTK toolkit (Bird et al., 2009) to compute
the similarity. See the Supplementary Material for
more details.

Creating Better Visual QA Datasets

In this section, we describe our approaches of remedying design deficiencies in the existing datasets
for the Visual QA task. We introduce two automatic and widely-applicable procedures to create
new decoys that can prevent learning models from
exploiting incident statistics in the datasets.
4.1

Methods

Main ideas Our procedures operate on a dataset
that already contains image-question-target (IQT)
triplets, i.e., we do not assume it has decoys already. For instance, we have used our procedures
to create a multiple-choice dataset from the Visual Genome dataset which has no decoy. We assume that each image in the dataset is coupled with
“multiple” QT pairs, which is the case in nearly all
the existing datasets. Given an IQT triplet (I, Q,
T), we create two sets of decoy answers.

Other details For QoU-decoys, we sort and
keep for each triplet the top N (e.g., 10,000) similar triplets from the entire dataset according to
the question similarity. Then for each triplet, we
compute the WUP-based similarity of each potential decoy to the target successively, and accept
those with similarity below 0.9 until we have K
decoys. We choose 0.9 according to (Malinowski
and Fritz, 2014). We also perform such a check
among selected decoys to ensure they are not very
similar to each other. For IoU-decoys, the potential decoys are sorted randomly. The WUP-based

• QoU-decoys. We search among all other triplets
that have similar questions to Q. The targets of
those triplets are then collected as the decoys for
T. As the targets to similar questions are likely

E.g., in Fig 1, for the question “What vehicle is pictured?”, the only answer that meets both principles is “train”,
which is the correct answer instead of being a decoy.

similarity with a threshold of 0.9 is then applied to
remove ambiguous decoys.

Comparison to other datasets

Several authors have noticed the design deficiencies in the existing databases and have proposed
“fixes” (Antol et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2015; Zhu
et al., 2016; Das et al., 2017). No dataset has used
a procedure to generate IoU-decoys. We empirically show that how the IoU-decoys significantly
remedy the design deficiencies in the datasets.
Several previous efforts have generated decoys
that are similar in spirit to our QoU-decoys. Yu et
al. (2015), Das et al. (2017), and Ding et al. (2016)
automatically find decoys from similar questions
or captions based on question templates and annotated objects, tri-grams and G LOV E embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014), and paragraph
vectors (Le and Mikolov, 2014) and linguistic surface similarity, respectively. The later two are for
different tasks from Visual QA, and only Ding
et al. (2016) consider removing semantically ambiguous decoys like ours. Antol et al. (2015) and
Zhu et al. (2016) ask humans to create decoys,
given the questions and targets. As shown earlier,
such decoys may disobey the rule of Neutrality.
Goyal et al. (2017) augment the VQA dataset
(Antol et al., 2015) (by human efforts) with additional IQT triplets to eliminate the shortcuts (language prior) in the open-ended setting. Their effort is complementary to ours on the multiplechoice setting. Note that an extended task of Visual QA, visual dialog (Das et al., 2017), also
adopts the latter setting.

Table 2: Summary of Visual QA datasets.

Visual7W Telling (Visual7W) (Zhu et al., 2016)
The dataset uses 47,300 images from MSCOCO
(Lin et al., 2014) and contains 139,868 IQA
triplets. Each has 3 decoys generated by humans.
Visual Genome (VG) (Krishna et al., 2017)
The dataset uses 101,174 images from MSCOCO
(Lin et al., 2014) and contains 1,445,322 IQT
triplets. No decoys are provided. Human annotators are asked to write diverse pairs of questions
and answers freely about an image or with respect
to some regions of it. On average an image is coupled with 14 question-answer pairs. We divide the
dataset into non-overlapping 50%/20%/30% for
training/validation/testing. Additionally, we partition such that each portion is a “superset” of the
corresponding one in Visual7W, respectively.
VQA2 (Goyal et al., 2017) and COCOQA (Ren
et al., 2015) We describe the datasets and experimental results in the Supplementary Material.
Creating decoys We create 3 QoU-decoys and
3 IoU-decoys for every IQT triplet in each dataset,
following the steps in Sect. 4.1. In the cases that
we cannot find 3 decoys, we include random ones
from the original set of decoys for VQA and Visual7W; for other datasets, we randomly include
those from the top 10 frequently-occurring targets.

Empirical Studies

Setup

Visual QA models We utilize the MLP models mentioned in Sect. 3 for all the experiments.
We denote MLP-A, MLP-QA, MLP-IA, MLPIQA as the models using A (Answers only), Q+A
(Question plus Answers), I+A (Image plus Answers), and I+Q+A (Image, Question and Answers) for multimodal information, respectively.
The hidden-layer has 8,192 neurons. We use a
200-layer ResNet (He et al., 2016) to compute visual features which are 2,048-dimensional. The
ResNet is pre-trained on ImageNet (Russakovsky
et al., 2015). The WORD 2 VEC feature (Mikolov
et al., 2013) for questions and answers are 300dimensional, pre-trained on Google News2 . The

We examine our automatic procedures for creating
decoys on five datasets. Table 2 summarizes the
characteristics of the three datasets we focus on.
VQA Real (Antol et al., 2015) The dataset uses
images from MSCOCO (Lin et al., 2014) under
the same training/validation/testing splits to construct IQA triplets. Totally 614,163 IQA triplets
are generated for 204,721 images. Each question
has 18 candidate answers: in general 3 decoys are
human-generated, 4 are randomly sampled, and 10
are randomly sampled frequent-occurring targets.
As the test set does not indicate the targets, our
studies focus on the training and validation sets.

minimizing the binary logistic loss of predicting
whether or not a candidate answer is the target of
the corresponding IQA triplet. Please see the Supplementary Material for details on optimization.
We further experiment with a variant of the spatial memory network (denoted as Attention) (Xu
and Saenko, 2016) and the HieCoAtt model (Lu

Effectiveness of new decoys A better set of decoys will force learning models to integrate all 3
pieces of information — images, questions and
answers — to make the correct selection from
multiple-choices. In particular, they should prevent learning algorithms from exploiting shortcuts
such that partial information is sufficient for performing well on the Visual QA task.
Table 3 clearly indicates that those goals have
been achieved. With the Orig decoys, the relatively small gain from MLP-IA to MLP-IQA suggests that the question information can be ignored
to attain good performance. However, with the
IoU-decoys which require questions to help to resolve (as image itself is inadequate to resolve),
the gain is substantial (from 27.3% to 84.1%).
Likewise, with the QoU-decoys (question itself
is not adequate to resolve), including images information improves from 40.7% (MLP-QA) substantially to 57.6% (MLP-IQA). Note that with
the Orig decoys, this gain is smaller (58.2% vs.
65.7%).
It is expected that MLP-IA matches better QoUdecoys but not IoU-decoys, and MLP-QA is the
other way around. Thus it is natural to combine
these two decoys. What is particularly appealing
is that MLP-IQA improves noticeably over models
learned with partial information on the combined
IoU +QoU-decoys (and “All” decoys4 ). Furthermore, using answer information only (MLP-A) attains about the chance-level accuracy.
On the VQA dataset (Table 4), the same observations hold, though to a lesser degree. On any
of the IoU or QoU columns, we observe substan-

Evaluation metric For VQA and VQA2, we
follow their protocols by comparing the picked answer to 10 human-generated targets. The accuracy is computed based on the number of exactly
matched targets (divided by 3 and clipped at 1).
For others, we compute the accuracy of picking
the target from multiple choices.
Decoy sets to compare For each dataset, we derive several variants: (1) Orig: the original decoys
from the datasets, (2) QoU: Orig replaced with
ones selected by our QoU-decoys generating procedure, (3) IoU: Orig replaced with ones selected
by our IoU-decoys generating procedure, (4) QoU
+IoU: Orig replaced with ones combining QoU
and IoU, (5) All: combining Orig, QoU, and IoU.
User studies Automatic decoy generation may
lead to ambiguous decoys as mentioned in Sect. 4
and (Zhu et al., 2016). We conduct a user study via
Amazon Mechanic Turk (AMT) to test humans’
performance on the datasets after they are remedied by our automatic procedures. We select 1,000
IQA triplets from each dataset. Each triplet is answered by three workers and in total 169 workers
get involved. The total cost is $215 — the rate for
every 20 triplets is $0.25. We report the average
human performance and compare it to the learning models’. See the Supplementary Material for
more details.

Results

The performances of learning models and humans
on the 3 datasets are reported in Table 3, 4, and 53 .

We note that the decoys in Orig are not trivial, which can
be seen from the gap between All and IoU +QoU. Our main
concern on Orig is that for those questions that machines can
accurately answer, they mostly rely on only partial information. This will thus hinder designing machines to fully comprehend and reason from multimodal information. We further
experiment on random decoys, which can achieve Neutrality
but not the other two principles, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in the Supplementary Material.

3

We note that in Table 3, the 4.3% drop of the human performance on IoU +QoU, compared to Orig, is likely due to
that IoU +QoU has more candidates (7 per question). Besides, the human performance on qaVG cannot be directly
compared to that on the other datasets, since the questions on
qaVG tend to focus on local image regions and are considered
harder.

it difficult to compare different models. By eliminating the shortcuts (i.e., on the combined IoU

importance to design advanced models for achieving human-level performance on Visual QA.

For completeness, we include the results on the
Visual Genome dataset in Table 5. This dataset has
no “Orig” decoys, and we have created a multiplechoice based dataset qaVG from it for the task —
it has over 1 million triplets, the largest dataset on
this task to our knowledge. On the combined IoU
+QoU-decoys, we again clearly see that machines
need to use all the information to succeed.
With qaVG, we also investigate whether it can
help improve the multiple-choice performances on
the other two datasets. We use the MLP-IQA
trained on qaVG with both IoU and QoU decoys
to initialize the models for the Visual7W and VQA
datasets. We report the accuracies before and after
fine-tuning, together with the best results learned
solely on those two datasets. As shown in Table 6,
fine-tuning largely improves the performance, justifying the finding by Fukui et al. (2016).

tial gains when the complementary information is
added to the model (such as MLP-IA to MLPIQA). All these improvements are much more visible than those observed on the original decoy sets.
Combining both Table 3 and 4, we notice that
the improvements from MLP-QA to MLP-IQA
tend to be lower when facing IoU-decoys. This is
also expected as it is difficult to have decoys that
are simultaneously both IoU and QoU — such answers tend to be the target answers. Nonetheless,
we deem this as a future direction to explore.
Differences across datasets Contrasting Visual7W to VQA (on the column IoU +QoU), we
notice that Visual7W tends to have bigger improvements in general. This is due to the fact that
VQA has many questions with “Yes” or “No” as
the targets — the only valid decoy to the target
“Yes” is “No”, and vice versa. As such decoys are
already captured by Orig of VQA (‘Yes” and “No”
are both top frequently-occurring targets), adding
other decoy answers will not make any noticeable
improvement. In Supplementary Material, however, we show that once we remove such questions/answers pairs, the degree of improvements
increases substantially.
Comparison on Visual QA models As presented in Table 3 and 4, MLP-IQA is on par with
or even outperforms Attention and HieCoAtt on
the Orig decoys, showing how the shortcuts make

In Fig. 2, we present examples of image-questiontarget triplets from V7W, VQA, and VG, together
with our IoU-decoys (A, B, C) and QoU-decoys
(D, E, F). G is the target. The predictions by the
corresponding MLP-IQA are also included. Ignoring information from images or questions makes
it extremely challenging to answer the triplet correctly, even for humans.
Our automatic procedures do fail at some
triplets, resulting in ambiguous decoys to the targets. See Fig. 3 for examples. We categorized
those failure cases into two situations.

the similarity is only 0.632, much lower than
that of 0.857 between “cat” and “dog”. This issue can be alleviated by considering alternative
semantic measures by WORD 2 VEC or by those
used in (Das et al., 2017; Ding et al., 2016) for
searching similar questions.
