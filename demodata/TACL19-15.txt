paper, we introduce CoQA,1 a Conversational
Question Answering dataset for measuring the
ability of machines to participate in a questionanswering style conversation. In CoQA, a machine
has to understand a text passage and answer a
series of questions that appear in a conversation.
We develop CoQA with three main goals in mind.
The first concerns the nature of questions in a
human conversation. Figure 1 shows a conversation between two humans who are reading a
passage, one acting as a questioner and the other as
an answerer. In this conversation, every question
after the first is dependent on the conversation
history. For instance, Q5 (Who?) is only a single
word and is impossible to answer without knowing
what has already been said. Posing short questions
is an effective human conversation strategy, but
such questions are difficult for machines to parse.
As is well known, state-of-the-art models rely
heavily on lexical similarity between a question
and a passage (Chen et al., 2016; Weissenborn
et al., 2017). At present, there are no largescale reading comprehension datasets that contain
questions that depend on a conversation history
(see Table 1) and this is what CoQA is mainly
developed for.2
The second goal of CoQA is to ensure the
naturalness of answers in a conversation. Many
existing QA datasets restrict answers to contiguous
text spans in a given passage (Table 1). Such
answers are not always natural—for example,
there is no span-based answer to Q4 (How many?)
in Figure 1. In CoQA, we propose that the answers
can be free-form text, while for each answer, we
also provide a text span from the passage as a
rationale to the answer. Therefore, the answer
to Q4 is simply Three and its rationale spans

Abstract
Humans gather information through conversations involving a series of interconnected
questions and answers. For machines to assist
in information gathering, it is therefore essential to enable them to answer conversational
questions. We introduce CoQA, a novel dataset for building Conversational Question Answering systems. Our dataset contains 127k
questions with answers, obtained from 8k
conversations about text passages from seven
diverse domains. The questions are conversational, and the answers are free-form text
with their corresponding evidence highlighted
in the passage. We analyze CoQA in depth
and show that conversational questions have
challenging phenomena not present in existing
reading comprehension datasets (e.g., coreference and pragmatic reasoning). We evaluate
strong dialogue and reading comprehension
models on CoQA. The best system obtains an
F1 score of 65.4%, which is 23.4 points behind
human performance (88.8%), indicating that
there is ample room for improvement. We
present CoQA as a challenge to the community at https://stanfordnlp.github.
io/coqa.

Introduction

We ask other people a question to either seek or
test their knowledge about a subject. Depending on
their answer, we follow up with another question
and their second answer builds on what has already
been discussed. This incremental aspect makes
human conversations succinct. An inability to
build and maintain common ground in this way is
part of why virtual assistants usually don’t seem
like competent conversational partners. In this

CoQA is pronounced as coca.
Concurrent with our work, Choi et al. (2018) also created
a conversational dataset with a similar goal, but it differs in
many aspects. We discuss the details in Section 7.

science. The last two are used for out-of-domain
evaluation.
To summarize, CoQA has the following key
characteristics:
• It consists of 127k conversation turns collected from 8k conversations over text passages. The average conversation length is
15 turns, and each turn consists of a question
and an answer.
• It contains free-form answers and each answer has a span-based rationale highlighted
in the passage.
• Its text passages are collected from seven diverse domains: five are used for in-domain
evaluation and two are used for out-ofdomain evaluation.
Almost half of CoQA questions refer back
to conversational history using anaphors, and a
large portion require pragmatic reasoning, making
it challenging for models that rely on lexical
cues alone. We benchmark several deep neural
network models, building on top of state-ofthe-art conversational and reading comprehension
models (Section 5). The best-performing system
achieves an F1 score of 65.4%. In contrast, humans
achieve 88.8% F1, 23.4% F1 higher, indicating
that there is a considerable room for improvement.

rationale (Ri ) that supports the answer.

across multiple sentences. Free-form answers have
been studied in previous reading comprehension
datasets for example, MS MARCO (Nguyen
et al., 2016) and NarrativeQA (Kočiskỳ et al.,
2018), and metrics such as BLEU or ROUGE
are used for evaluation due to the high variance
of possible answers. One key difference in our
setting is that we require answerers to first select
a text span as the rationale and then edit it to
obtain a free-form answer.3 Our method strikes
a balance between naturalness of answers and
reliable automatic evaluation, and it results in a
high human agreement (88.8% F1 word overlap
among human annotators).
The third goal of CoQA is to enable building
QA systems that perform robustly across domains.
The current QA datasets mainly focus on a single
domain, which makes it hard to test the generalization ability of existing models. Hence we
collect our dataset from seven different domains—
children’s stories, literature, middle and high
school English exams, news, Wikipedia, Reddit, and

Task Definition

Given a passage and a conversation so far, the task
is to answer the next question in the conversation.
Each turn in the conversation contains a question
and an answer.
For the example in Figure 2, the conversation
begins with question Q1 . We answer Q1 with A1
based on the evidence R1 , which is a contiguous
text span from the passage. In this example,
the answerer only wrote the Governor as the
answer but selected a longer rationale The Virginia
governor’s race.
When we come to Q2 (Where?), we must
refer back to the conversation history, otherwise
its answer could be Virginia or Richmond or
something else. In our task, conversation history
is indispensable for answering many questions.
We use conversation history Q1 and A1 to answer
Q2 with A2 based on the evidence R2 . Formally,
to answer Qn , it depends on the conversation

In contrast, in NarrativeQA, the annotators were encouraged to use their own words and copying was not allowed in
their interface.

nature of questions requires us to reason from
multiple sentences (the current question and the
previous questions or answers, and sentences from
the passage). It is common that a single question
may require a rationale spanning across multiple
sentences (e.g., Q1 , Q4 , and Q5 in Figure 1). We
describe additional question and answer types in
Section 4.
Note that we collect rationales as (optional)
evidence to help answer questions. However, they
are not provided at testing time. A model needs
to decide on the evidence by itself and derive the
final answer.

Dataset Collection

For each conversation, we use two annotators,
a questioner and an answerer. This setup has
several advantages over using a single annotator
to act both as a questioner and an answerer: 1)
when two annotators chat about a passage, their
dialogue flow is natural; 2) when one annotator
responds with a vague question or an incorrect
answer, the other can raise a flag, which we use
to identify bad workers; and 3) the two annotators
can discuss guidelines (through a separate chat
window) when they have disagreements. These
measures help to prevent spam and to obtain high
agreement data.4 We use Amazon Mechanical
Turk to pair workers on a passage through the
ParlAI MTurk API (Miller et al., 2017).

history: Q1 , A1 , . . ., Qn−1 , An−1 . For an unanswerable question, we give unknown as the
final answer and do not highlight any rationale.
In this example, we observe that the entity of
focus changes as the conversation progresses. The
questioner uses his to refer to Terry in Q4 and he to
Ken in Q5 . If these are not resolved correctly, we
end up with incorrect answers. The conversational

Due to Amazon Mechanical Turk terms of service, we
allowed a single worker to act both as a questioner and an
answerer after a minute of waiting. This constitutes around
12% of the data. We include this data in the training set only.

Collection Interface
Domain

We have different interfaces for a questioner and
an answerer (see Appendix). A questioner’s role
is to ask questions, and an answerer’s role is
to answer questions in addition to highlighting
rationales. Both questioner and answerer see the
conversation that happened until now, that is,
questions and answers from previous turns and
rationales are kept hidden. While framing a new
question, we want questioners to avoid using exact
words in the passage in order to increase lexical
diversity. When they type a word that is already
present in the passage, we alert them to paraphrase
the question if possible. While answering, we want
answerers to stick to the vocabulary in the passage
in order to limit the number of possible answers.
We encourage this by asking them to first highlight
a rationale (text span), which is then automatically
copied into the answer box, and we further ask
them to edit the copied text to generate a natural
answer. We found 78% of the answers have at
least one edit such as changing a word’s case or
adding a punctuation.

the test set.

3.3

Collecting Multiple Answers

Some questions in CoQA may have multiple
valid answers. For example, another answer to
Q4 in Figure 2 is A Republican candidate. In
order to account for answer variations, we collect
three additional answers for all questions in the
development and test data. Because our data
are conversational, questions influence answers,
which in turn influence the follow-up questions.
In the previous example, if the original answer
was A Republican Candidate, then the following
question Which party does he belong to? would not
have occurred in the first place. When we show
questions from an existing conversation to new
answerers, it is likely they will deviate from the
original answers, which makes the conversation
incoherent. It is thus important to bring them to a
common ground with the original answer.
We achieve this by turning the answer collection
task into a game of predicting original answers.
First, we show a question to an answerer, and
when she answers it, we show the original answer
and ask her to verify if her answer matches the
original. For the next question, we ask her to guess
the original answer and verify again. We repeat
this process with the same answerer until the
conversation is complete. The entire conversation
history is shown at each turn (question, answer,
original answer for all previous turns but not the
rationales). In our pilot experiment, the human
F1 score is increased by 5.4% when we use this
verification setup.

Passage Selection

We select passages from seven diverse domains:
children’s stories from MCTest (Richardson et al.,
2013), literature from Project Gutenberg,5 middle
and high school English exams from RACE (Lai
et al., 2017), news articles from CNN (Hermann
et al., 2015), articles from Wikipedia, Reddit articles from the Writing Prompts dataset (Fan et al.,
2018), and science articles from AI2 Science
Questions (Welbl et al., 2017).
Not all passages in these domains are equally
good for generating interesting conversations.
A passage with just one entity often results in
questions that entirely focus on that entity. Therefore, we select passages with multiple entities,
events, and pronominal references using Stanford
CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014). We truncate
long articles to the first few paragraphs that result
in around 200 words.
Table 2 shows the distribution of domains. We
reserve the Reddit and Science domains for outof-domain evaluation. For each in-domain dataset,
we split the data such that there are 100 passages
in the development set, 100 passages in the test
set, and the rest in the training set. For each out5

Comparison with SQuAD 2.0

SQuAD has been the main benchmark for reading comprehension. In the following, we perform
an in-depth comparison of CoQA and the latest
version of SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2018).
Figure 3(a) and Figure 3(b) show the distribution
of frequent trigram prefixes. Because of the freeform nature of answers, we expect a richer variety
of questions in CoQA than in SQuAD. While
nearly half of SQuAD questions are dominated by
what questions, the distribution of CoQA is spread
across multiple question types. Several sectors
indicated by prefixes did, was, is, does, and and
are frequent in CoQA but are completely absent in
SQuAD. Whereas coreferences are non-existent
in SQuAD, almost every sector of CoQA contains
coreferences (he, him, she, it, they), indicating that
CoQA is highly conversational.
Because a conversation is spread over multiple
turns, we expect conversational questions and
answers to be shorter than in a standalone interaction. In fact, questions in CoQA can be made up
of just one or two words (who?, when?, why?). As
seen in Table 3, on average, a question in CoQA

on obtaining them, resulting in higher frequency
than in CoQA. SQuAD has 100% span-based
answers by design, whereas in CoQA, 66.8% of
the answers overlap with the passage after ignoring
punctuation and case mismatches.6 The rest of the
answers, 33.2%, do not exactly overlap with the
passage (see Section 4.3). It is worth noting that

datasets have a high number of named entities and
noun phrases as answers.

paraphrase of the rationale, we classify it as
paraphrasing. These questions contain phenomena such as synonymy, antonymy, hypernymy,
hyponymy, and negation. These constitute a large
portion of questions, around 43.0%. The rest,
27.2%, have no lexical cues, and we classify them
as pragmatics. These include phenomena like
common sense and presupposition. For example,
the question Was he loud and boisterous? is not a
direct paraphrase of the rationale he dropped his
feet with the lithe softness of a cat but the rationale combined with world knowledge can answer
this question.
For the relationship between a question and its
conversation history, we classify questions into
whether they are dependent or independent of the
conversation history. If dependent, whether the
questions contain an explicit marker or not. Our
analysis shows that around 30.5% questions do
not rely on coreference with the conversational
history and are answerable on their own. Almost
half of the questions (49.7%) contain explicit
coreference markers such as he, she, it. These
either refer to an entity or an event introduced
in the conversation. The remaining 19.8% do not
have explicit coreference markers but refer to an
entity or event implicitly (these are often cases of
ellipsis, as in the examples in Table 5).

Linguistic Phenomena

We further analyze the questions for their relationship with the passages and the conversation
history. We sample 150 questions in the development set and annotate various phenomena as
shown in Table 5.
If a question contains at least one content word
that appears in the rationale, we classify it as
lexical match. These constitute around 29.8% of
the questions. If it has no lexical match but is a

If punctuation and case are not ignored, only 37% of the

Analysis of Free-form Answers

Because of the free-form nature of CoQA’s
answers, around 33.2% of them do not exactly
overlap with the given passage. We analyze
100 conversations to study the behavior of such
answers.7 As shown in Table 6, the answers Yes
and No constitute 48.5% and 30.3%, respectively,
totaling 78.8%. The next majority, around 14.3%,
are edits to text spans to improve the fluency (naturalness) of answers. More than two thirds of these
edits are just one-word edits, either inserting or
deleting a word. This indicates that text spans are a
good approximation for natural answers—positive
news for span-based reading comprehension models. The remaining one third involve multiple
edits. Although multiple edits are challenging to
evaluate using automatic metrics, we observe that
many of these answers partially overlap with passage, indicating that word overlap is still a reliable
automatic evaluation metric in our setting. The
rest of the answers include counting (5.1%) and
selecting a choice from the question (1.8%).

5.1

Conversation Flow

Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models have
shown promising results for generating conversational responses (Vinyals and Le, 2015; Serban
et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018). Motivated by their
success, we use a sequence-to-sequence with attention model for generating answers (Bahdanau
et al., 2015). We append the conversation history and the current question to the passage, as
p <q> qi−n <a> ai−n . . . <q> qi−1 <a> ai−1
<q> qi , and feed it into a bidirectional long
short-term memory (LSTM) encoder, where n is
the size of the history to be used. We generate
the answer using an LSTM decoder which attends
to the encoder states. Additionally, as the answer
words are likely to appear in the original passage,
we employ a copy mechanism in the decoder
which allows to (optionally) copy a word from
the passage (Gu et al., 2016; See et al., 2017).
This model is referred to as the Pointer-Generator
network, PGNet.

A coherent conversation must have smooth transitions between turns. We expect the narrative
structure of the passage to influence our conversation flow. We split each passage into 10 uniform
chunks, and identify chunks of interest in a given
turn and its transition based on rationale spans.
Figure 4 shows the conversation flow of the first
10 turns. The starting turns tend to focus on the
first few chunks and as the conversation advances,
the focus shifts to the later chunks. Moreover,
the turn transitions are smooth, with the focus
often remaining in the same chunk or moving to a
neighboring chunk. Most frequent transitions happen to the first and the last chunks, and likewise
these chunks have diverse outward transitions.

Conversational Models

Models

Given a passage p, the conversation history
{q1 , a1 , . . . qi−1 , ai−1 }, and a question qi , the task
is to predict the answer ai . Gold answers a1 ,
a2 , . . . , ai−1 are used to predict ai , similar to the
setup discussed in Section 3.3.
Our task can either be modeled as a conversational response generation problem or a
reading comprehension problem. We evaluate

5.2

Reading Comprehension Models

The state-of-the-art reading comprehension models for extractive question answering focus on
finding a span in the passage that matches the
question best (Seo et al., 2016; Chen et al.,
2017; Yu et al., 2018). Because their answers are
limited to spans, they cannot handle questions

7

We only pick the questions in which none of its answers
can be found as a span in the passage.

6

whose answers do not overlap with the passage
(e.g., Q3 , Q4 , and Q5 in Figure 1). However, this
limitation makes them more effective learners than
conversational models, which have to generate
an answer from a large space of pre-defined
vocabulary.
We use the Document Reader (DrQA) model
of Chen et al. (2017), which has demonstrated
strong performance on multiple datasets (Rajpurkar
et al., 2016; Labutov et al., 2018). Because DrQA
requires text spans as answers during training, we
select the span that has the highest lexical overlap
(F1 score) with the original answer as the gold
answer. If the answer appears multiple times in
the story we use the rationale to find the correct
one. If any answer word does not appear in the
story, we fall back to an additional unknown token
as the answer (about 17% in the training set).
We prepend each question with its past questions
and answers to account for conversation history,
similar to the conversational models.
Considering that a significant portion of answers in our dataset are yes or no (Table 4), we
also include an augmented reading comprehension
model for comparison. We add two additional
tokens, yes and no, to the end of the passage—if the
gold answer is yes or no, the model is required to
predict the corresponding token as the gold span;
otherwise it does the same as the previous model.
We refer to this model as Augmented DrQA.

Evaluation Metric

Following SQuAD, we use macro-average F1
score of word overlap as our main evaluation
metric.9 We use the gold answers of history to
predict the next answer. In SQuAD, for computing
a model’s performance, each individual prediction
is compared against n human answers resulting
in n F1 scores, the maximum of which is chosen
as the prediction’s F1.10 For each question, we
average out F1 across these n sets, both for humans
and models. In our final evaluation, we use n = 4
human answers for every question (the original
answer and 3 additionally collected answers).
The articles a, an, and the and punctuations are
excluded in evaluation.
6.2

Experimental Setup

For all the experiments of seq2seq and PGNet, we
use the OpenNMT toolkit (Klein et al., 2017) and
its default settings: 2-layers of LSTMs with 500
hidden units for both the encoder and the decoder.
The models are optimized using SGD, with an
initial learning rate of 1.0 and a decay rate of 0.5.
A dropout rate of 0.3 is applied to all layers.
For the DrQA experiments, we use the implementation from the original paper (Chen et al.,
2017). We tune the hyperparameters on the development data: the number of turns to use from the
conversation history, the number of layers, number of each hidden units per layer, and dropout
rate. The best configuration we find is 3 layers of
LSTMs with 300 hidden units for each layer. A
dropout rate of 0.4 is applied to all LSTM layers
and a dropout rate of 0.5 is applied to word embeddings. We used Adam to optimize DrQA models.
We initialized the word projection matrix with
GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) for conversational
models and fastText (Bojanowski et al., 2017) for
reading comprehension models, based on empirical performance. We update the projection matrix
during training in order to learn embeddings for
delimiters such as <q>.

A Combined Model

Finally, we propose a model that combines the
advantages from both conversational models and
extractive reading comprehension models. We use
DrQA with PGNet in a combined model, in which
DrQA first points to the answer evidence in the
text, and PGNet naturalizes the evidence into an
answer. For example, for Q5 in Figure 1, we expect
that DrQA first predicts the rationale R5 , and then
PGNet generates A5 from R5 .
We make a few changes to DrQA and PGNet
based on empirical performance. For DrQA, we
require the model to predict the answer directly
if the answer is a substring of the rationale, and
to predict the rationale otherwise. For PGNet,
we provide the current question and DrQA’s span
predictions as input to the encoder and the decoder
aims to predict the final answer.8

SQuAD also uses exact-match metric, however, we think
F1 is more appropriate for our dataset because of the freeform answers.
10
However, for computing human performance, a human
prediction is only compared against n − 1 human answers,
resulting in underestimating human performance. We fix this
bias by partitioning n human answers into n different sets,
each set containing n−1 answers, similar to Choi et al. (2018).

We feed DrQA’s oracle spans into PGNet during training.

Results and Discussion

it still lags behind DrQA by 8.5 points. A reason could be that PGNet has to memorize the
whole passage before answering a question, a
huge overhead that DrQA avoids. But DrQA fails
miserably in answering questions with answers
that do not overlap with the passage (see row No
span found in Table 8). The augmented DrQA
circumvents this problem with additional yes/no
tokens, giving it a boost of 12.8 points. When
DrQA is fed into PGNet, we empower both
DrQA and PGNet—DrQA in producing free-form
answers, PGNet in focusing on the rationale

Table 7 presents the results of the models on the
development and test data. Considering the results
on the test set, the seq2seq model performs the
worst, generating frequently occurring answers
irrespective of whether these answers appear in
the passage or not, a well known behavior of
conversational models (Li et al., 2016). PGNet
alleviates the frequent response problem by focusing on the vocabulary in the passage and it
outperforms seq2seq by 17.8 points. However,

with the augmented DrQA (65.1 vs. 65.4).

Table 9: Results on the development set with
different history sizes. History size indicates the
number of previous turns prepended to the current
question. Each turn contains a question and its
answer.

In-domain vs. Out-of-domain All models perform worse on out-of-domain datasets compared
with in-domain datasets. The best model drops by
6.6 points. For in-domain results, both the best
model and humans find the literature domain
harder than the others because literature’s
vocabulary requires proficiency in English. For
out-of-domain results, the Reddit domain is apparently harder. Whereas humans achieve high
performance on children’s stories, models perform
poorly, probably because of the fewer training
examples in this domain compared with others.11
Both humans and models find Wikipedia easy.

than pragmatic questions. This is also the case with
the combined model, but we could not explain the
behavior of other models. Where humans find the
questions without coreferences easier than those
with coreferences, the models behave sporadically. Humans find implicit coreferences easier
than explicit coreferences. A conjecture is that
implicit coreferences depend directly on the previous turn, whereas explicit coreferences may have
long distance dependency on the conversation.
Importance of conversation history Finally,
we examine how important the conversation history is for the dataset. Table 9 presents the results
with a varied number of previous turns used
as conversation history. All models succeed at
leveraging history but the gains are little beyond
one previous turn. As we increase the history size,
the performance decreases.
We also perform an experiment on humans to
measure the trade-off between their performance
and the number of previous turns shown. Based
on the heuristic that short questions likely depend
on the conversation history, we sample 300 one or
two word questions, and collect answers to these
varying the number of previous turns shown.
When we do not show any history, human performance drops to 19.9 F1, as opposed to 86.4 F1
when full history is shown. When the previous turn
(question and answer) is shown, their performance
boosts to 79.8 F1, suggesting that the previous turn
plays an important role in understanding the current question. If the last two turns are shown, they
reach up to 85.3 F1, almost close to the performance when the full history is shown. This suggests that most questions in a conversation have a
limited dependency within a bound of two turns.

Error Analysis Table 8 presents fine-grained
results of models and humans on the development
set. We observe that humans have the highest
disagreement on the unanswerable questions. The
human agreement on answers that do not overlap
with passage is lower than on answers that do
overlap. This is expected because our evaluation
metric is based on word overlap rather than on
the meaning of words. For the question did Jenny
like her new room?, human answers she loved
it and yes are both accepted. Finding the perfect
evaluation metric for abstractive responses is still
a challenging problem (Liu et al., 2016; Chaganty
et al., 2018) and beyond the scope of our work.
For our models’ performance, seq2seq and PGNet
perform well on non-overlapping answers, and
DrQA performs well on overlapping answers,
thanks to their respective designs. The augmented
and combined models improve on both categories.
Among the different question types, humans
find lexical matches the easiest, followed by paraphrasing, and pragmatics the hardest—this is expected because questions with lexical matches and
paraphrasing share some similarity with the passage, thus making them relatively easier to answer

2017; Hori et al., 2018).
Naturalness There are various ways to curate
questions: removing words from a declarative
sentence to create a fill-in-the-blank question
(Hermann et al., 2015), using a hand-written
grammar to create artificial questions (Weston
et al., 2016; Welbl et al., 2018), paraphrasing
artificial questions to natural questions (Saha et al.,
2018; Talmor and Berant, 2018), or, in our case,
letting humans ask natural questions (Rajpurkar
et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2016). While the former enable collecting large and cheap datasets,
the latter enable collecting natural questions.
Recent efforts emphasize collecting questions
without seeing the knowledge source in order
to encourage the independence of question and
documents (Joshi et al., 2017; Dunn et al., 2017;
Kočiskỳ et al., 2018). Because we allow a questioner to see the passage, we incorporate measures
to increase independence, although complete independence is not attainable in our setup (Section 3.1).
However, an advantage of our setup is that the
questioner can validate the answerer on the spot
resulting in high agreement data.

Table 10: Error analysis of questions with answers
that do not overlap with the text passage.
DrQA is a bit better (0.3 F1 on the testing set)
than the combined model, the latter model has
the following benefits: 1) The combined model
provides a rationale for every answer, which can
be used to justify whether the answer is correct
or not (e.g., yes/no questions); and 2) we don’t
have to decide on the set of augmented classes
beforehand, which helps in answering a wide
range of questions like counting and multiple
choice (Table 10). We also look closer into the
outputs of the two models. Although the combined
model is still far from perfect, it does correctly
as desired in many examples—for example, for a
counting question, it predicts a rationale current
affairs, politics, and culture and generates an
answer three; for a question With who?, it predicts
a rationale Mary and her husband, Rick, and then
compresses it into Mary and Rick for improving
the fluency; and for a multiple choice question
Does this help or hurt their memory of the event?
it predicts a rationale this obsession may prevent
their brains from remembering and answers hurt.
We think there is still great room for improving the
combined model and we leave it to future work.

Conversational Modeling Our focus is on questions that appear in a conversation. Iyyer et al.
(2017) and Talmor and Berant (2018) break down
a complex question into a series of simple questions mimicking conversational QA. Our work is
closest to Das et al. (2017) and Saha et al. (2018),
who perform conversational QA on images and a
knowledge graph, respectively, with the latter focusing on questions obtained by paraphrasing templates.
In parallel to our work, Choi et al. (2018) also
created a dataset of conversations in the form of
questions and answers on text passages. In our
interface, we show a passage to both the questioner
and the answerer, whereas their interface only
shows a title to the questioner and the full passage
to the answerer. Because their setup encourages
the answerer to reveal more information for the following questions, their average answer length is
15.1 words (our average is 2.7). While the human performance on our test set is 88.8 F1, theirs is 74.6 F1.
Moreover, although CoQA’s answers can be freeform text, their answers are restricted only to extractive text spans. Our dataset contains passages
from seven diverse domains, whereas their dataset
is built only from Wikipedia articles about people.

Related work

We organize CoQA’s relation to existing work
under the following criteria.
Knowledge source We answer questions about
text passages—our knowledge source. Another
common knowledge source is machine-friendly
databases, which organize world facts in the
form of a table or a graph (Berant et al., 2013;
Pasupat and Liang, 2015; Bordes et al., 2015;
Saha et al., 2018; Talmor and Berant, 2018).
However, understanding their structure requires
expertise, making it challenging to crowd-source
large QA datasets without relying on templates.
Like passages, other human-friendly sources are

Concurrently, Saeidi et al. (2018) created a conversational QA dataset for regulatory text such as
tax and visa regulations. Their answers are limited
to yes or no along with a positive characteristic of
permitting to ask clarification questions when a
given question cannot be answered. Elgohary et al.
(2018) proposed a sequential question answering dataset collected from Quiz Bowl tournaments, where a sequence contains multiple related
questions. These questions are related to the same
concept while not focusing on the dialogue aspects
(e.g., coreference). Zhou et al. (2018) is another
dialogue dataset based on a single movie-related
Wikipedia article, in which two workers are asked
to chat about the content. Their dataset is more
like chit-chat style conversations whereas our
dataset focuses on multi-turn question answering.

text spans as rationales, and text passages from
seven diverse domains. We hope this work will stir
more research in conversational modeling, a key
ingredient for enabling natural human–machine
communication.

interest in developing datasets that test specific
reasoning abilities: algebraic reasoning (Clark,
2015), logical reasoning (Weston et al., 2016),
common sense reasoning (Ostermann et al., 2018),
and multi-fact reasoning (Welbl et al., 2018;

Recent Progress on CoQA Since we first released the dataset in August 2018, the progress
of developing better models on CoQA has been
rapid. Instead of simply prepending the current
question with its previous questions and answers,
Huang et al. (2019) proposed a more sophisticated
solution to effectively stack single-turn models
along the conversational flow. Others (e.g., Zhu
et al., 2018) attempted to incorporate the most
recent pretrained language representation model
BERT (Devlin et al., 2018)12 into CoQA and
demonstrated superior results. As of the time we
finalized the paper (Jan 8, 2019), the state-of-art
F1 score on the test set was 82.8.

curating diverse categories of questions that were
not present in the guidelines (e.g., true or false,
fill in the blank and time series questions). We
pay workers an hourly wage around 8–15 USD.

Worker Selection
First each worker has to pass a qualification test
that assesses their understanding of the guidelines of conversational QA. The success rate for
the qualification test is 57% with 960 attempted
workers. The guidelines indicate this is a conversation about a passage in the form of questions
and answers, an example conversation and do’s
and don’ts. However, we give complete freedom
for the workers to judge what is good and bad
during the real conversation. This helped us in

Annotation Interface
Figure 5 shows the annotation interfaces for both
questioners and answerers.
Additional Examples
We provide additional examples in Figure 7 and
Figure 6.
