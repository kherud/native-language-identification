Abstract

irwin@research.att.com

The rising and popularity of Community Question Answering (CQA) sites provides an alternative to ASQA. CQA
sites such as Yahoo! Answers1 , Google Confucius (Si et al.
2010), and Baidu Zhidao2 provide platforms for people to
post questions, answer questions, and give feedbacks to the
posted items (Adamic et al. 2008; Lou et al. 2011). The
structure of QA archives from CQA sites makes these QA
pairs extremely valuable to ASQA (Xue, Jeon, and Croft
2008; Zhou et al. 2011; Zhou, Lyu, and King 2012). However, the inherently ill-phrased, vague, and complex nature
of questions in CQA sites makes question analysis challenging. In addition, the lack of labeled data hinders the adventure of effective question analysis.

Automatic Subjective Question Answering (ASQA), which
aims at answering users’ subjective questions using summaries of multiple opinions, becomes increasingly important.
One challenge of ASQA is that expected answers for subjective questions may not readily exist in the Web. The rising and
popularity of Community Question Answering (CQA) sites,
which provide platforms for people to post and answer questions, provides an alternative to ASQA. One important task of
ASQA is question subjectivity identification, which identifies
whether a user is asking a subjective question. Unfortunately,
there has been little labeled training data available for this
task. In this paper, we propose an approach to collect training
data automatically by utilizing social signals in CQA sites
without involving any manual labeling. Experimental results
show that our data-driven approach achieves 9.37% relative
improvement over the supervised approach using manually
labeled data, and achieves 5.15% relative gain over a stateof-the-art semi-supervised approach. In addition, we propose
several heuristic features for question subjectivity identification. By adding these features, we achieve 11.23% relative
improvement over word n-gram feature under the same experimental setting.

The explicit support of social signals in CQA sites, such
as rating content, voting answers, and posting comments,
aggregates rich knowledge of community wisdom. Thus, it
is worthwhile to investigate whether we can leverage these
social signals to advance question analysis. Motivated by
Halevy, Norvig and Pereira’s argument “Web-scale learning is to use available large-scale data rather than hoping
for annotated data that isn’t available” (Halevy, Norvig, and
Pereira 2009), and inspired by the unreasonable effectiveness of data in statistical speech recognition, statistical machine translation (Halevy, Norvig, and Pereira 2009), and
semantic relationship learning (Riezler, Liu, and Vasserman
2008), our approach works towards utilizing social signals
to collect training data for question analysis without manual
labeling.

Introduction

Automatic Question Answering (AQA) has been a longstanding research problem which attracts contributions from
the information retrieval and natural language processing communities. AQA ranges from Automatic Subjective Question Answering (ASQA) (Soricut and Brill 2004;
Li et al. 2008) to Automatic Factual Question Answering
(AFQA) (Harabagiu et al. 2001; Demner-Fushman and Lin
2007; Ferrucci et al. 2010). Although much progress has
been made in AFQA, with the notable example of the IBM
Watson system (Ferrucci et al. 2010), high quality ASQA is
still beyond the state-of-the-art. There are two fundamental
differences of ASQA compared with AFQA: firstly, ASQA
aims at returning opinions instead of facts; secondly, ASQA
aims at returning an answer summarized from different perspectives instead of a fixed answer.

As a test case of our study, we focus on one important aspect of question analysis: question subjectivity identification
(QSI). The goal is to identify whether a question is a subjective question. The asker of a subjective question expects
one or more subjective answers, and the user intent is to collect people’s opinions. The asker of an objective question
expects an authoritative answer based on common knowledge or universal truth (Aikawa, Sakai, and Yamana 2011).
High quality QSI could be used to decide whether the system
should try to identify the correct answer (AFQA) or summarize a diversity of opinions (ASQA).

Like (L): in CQA sites, users like an answer if they find
the answer is useful. Even the best answer of a question has
been chosen, users could like other answers as well as the
best answer. The intuition of the like signal is as follows: answers posted to a subjective question are opinions. Due to
different tastes of the large community of users, not only the
best answer, but also other answers may receive likes from
users. Thus, if the best answer receives similar number of
likes with other answers, it is very likely that the question
is subjective. If a question is objective, the majority of users
would like an answer which explains universal truth or common knowledge in the most detailed manner. Thus, the best
answer would receive extremely high likes than other answers. Equation (1) presents the criteria of selecting positive
training data:

Question classification has been long studied in the question
answering community. Stoyanov et al. (Stoyanov, Cardie,
and Wiebe 2005) conducted deep analysis of the questions
by manually classifying questions along several orientation
dimensions. Ferrucci et al. (Ferrucci et al. 2010) employed
question classification in DeepQA project. However, most
previous research works focused on factual questions. In
contrast, our work analyzes complex and realistic questions
in CQA services. Automatic question answering has been an
active area of research (Soricut and Brill 2004). Many existing approaches considered specific domains (Harabagiu
et al. 2001; Demner-Fushman and Lin 2007), with the notable exception of the recent IBM Watson system (Ferrucci et al. 2010). Different from previous automatic factual
question answering systems, Dang et al. (Dang, Kelly, and
Lin 2007) started to address automatic subjective question
answering in a controlled TREC opinion track. But questions in CQA services are more complex compared with
the controlled TREC track. Li et al. (Li et al. 2008) employed a supervised framework for question subjectivity prediction, and a subsequent work of Li et al. (Li, Liu, and
Agichtein 2008) proposed a co-training approach. Aikawa
et al. (Aikawa, Sakai, and Yamana 2011) employed a supervised approach in Japanese subjective question classification. While previous approaches relied on manually labeled
data, our work utilizes social signals in CQA services to automatically collect training data without manual labeling.
There are existing works (Turney 2002; Hu and Liu 2004;
Pang and Lee 2008) on classifying sentences or text fragment as being overall positive or negative, but our work focuses on classifying questions as being subjective or objective. There are approaches on utilizing online repositories as
training data for some supervised task. Surdeanu et al. (Surdeanu, Ciaramita, and Zaragoza 2008) used publicly available online QA collections to investigate features for answer ranking without the need for costly human evaluations.
Mintz et al. (Mintz et al. 2009) used Freebase, a large semantic database, to provide distant supervision for relation
extraction. Bernhard et al. (Bernhard and Gurevych 2009)
presented three datasets for training statistical word translation models for use in answer finding. Blitzer et al. (Blitzer,
Dredze, and Pereira 2007) employed structural correspondence learning on unlabeled data of different domains to perform domain adaptation for sentiment classification. Zhou
et al. (Zhou et al. 2009; 2010) employed tags to perform
interested-based recommendation. However, different from
these approaches, our work utilizes social signals to collect
training data effectively.

where α is a parameter, Qother answer is an answer except the
best answer of a question Q, and MAX(·) is the maximum
function. Like signal is commonly found in CQA sites, such
as rate in Yahoo! Answers, support in Baidu Zhidao and like
in AnswerBag3 .
Vote (V): users could vote for the best answer in CQA
sites. An answer that receives the most votes is chosen as
the best answer. The intuition of vote signal is as follows:
the percentage of votes of the best answer of an objective
question should be high, since it is relatively easy to identify
which answer contains the most thorough universal truth or
common knowledge. However, users may vote for different
answers of a subjective question since they may support different opinions, resulting in a relatively low percentage of
votes on the best answer. Equation (3) shows the criteria of
selecting positive training data:
V (Qbest

answer ) ≤ β,

where V (·) is the percentage of votes of an answer, and β
is a parameter. Equation (4) shows the criteria of selecting
negative training data:
V (Qbest

where γ is a parameter. There is vote signal in many popular CQA sites, such as Yahoo! Answers, Baidu Zhidao, and
Quora4 .
Source (S): to increase the chance of an answer to be
selected as the best answer, users often provide sources of
their answers. A source of an answer is a reference to authoritative resources. The intuition of source signal is that

Question Subjectivity Identification

We treat question subjectivity identification as a classification task. Subjective questions are considered as positive instances, and objective questions are considered as negative
instances. In this section, we propose several social signals
for collecting training data, and propose several heuristic
features for the QSI task.

Social signal that implies users’ willingness to answer a question.

source is only available for an objective question that has a
fact answer. For an subjective question, users just post their
opinions without referencing authorities. In our approach,
we collect questions with source as negative training data.
Source signal exists in many popular CQA sites such as Yahoo! Answers, Baidu Zhidao, and AnswerBag.
Poll and Survey (PS): since a large number of community users are brought together in CQA sites, users often post
poll and survey questions. The intuition of poll and survey
signal is that the user intent of a poll and survey question
is to seek opinions on a certain topic. Thus, a poll and survey question is very likely to be a subjective question. In
addition, CQA sites often have mechanisms to enable users
to post poll and survey questions. For example, Yahoo! Answers has a dedicated category named poll and survey. In
our approach, we collect poll and survey questions as positive training data.
Answer Number (AN): the number of posted answers to
each question in CQA sites varies a lot. The intuition of answer number signal is as follows: users may post opinions
to a subjective question even they notice there are other answers for the question. Thus, the number of answers of a
subjective question may be large. However, users may not
post answers to an objective question that has already received other answers since an expected answer is usually
fixed. Thus, a large answer number may indicate subjectivity of a question, but a small answer number may be due to
many reasons, such as objectivity, small page views. Equation (5) presents the criteria of collecting positive training
data.
AN(Q) ≥ θ,
(5)

have a large amount of training data. Specifically, each word
n-gram is represented with its tf value.
Besides basic features, we also study several light-weight
heuristic features in this paper. These heuristic features
could be computed efficiently, leading to the scalability of
proposed approach.
Question length (qlength): information needs of subjective questions are complex, and users often use descriptions (Wang et al. 2010) to explain their questions, leading
to larger question length. We investigate whether question
length would help QSI. We divide question length into 10
buckets, and the corresponding bucket number is used as a
feature.
Request word (rword): we observe that in CQA sites,
users use some particular words to explicitly indicate their
request for seeking opinions. We refer to these words as request words. Specifically, 9 words are manually selected,
i.e. “should”, “might”, “anyone”, “can”, “shall”, “may”,
“would”, “could”, and “please”. The total number of request
words is used as a feature.
Subjectivity clue (sclue): we investigate whether external lexicons would help QSI. Specifically, in this study, we
utilize subjectivity clues from the work of Wilson et al. (Wilson, Wiebe, and Hoffmann 2005), which contain a lexicon of
over 8000 subjectivity clues. Subjectivity clues are manually
compiled word lists that may be used to express opinions,
i.e., they have subjective usages.
Punctuation density (pdensity): punctuation density is
measured according to the density of punctuation marks in
questions. Equation (6) presents the formulation of calculating punctuation density for a question:

where AN(·) is the number of answers of a question, and θ
is a parameter. Table 1 summarizes all social signals that are
investigated in this study.

Feature Investigation
Grammatical modifier (gmodifier): inspired by opinion
mining research of using grammatical modifiers on judging users’ positive and negative opinions, we investigate the
effectiveness of using grammatical modifier as a feature.
Specifically, adjective and adverb are considered as grammatical modifiers.
Entity (entity): the expected answer for an objective
question is fact or common knowledge, leading to less relationships among entities compared with a complex subjective question. Thus, we conjecture that the number of entities
varies between subjective and objective questions. Specifically, we use noun as the surrogate of entity in our study.

Word (word): word feature is shown to be effective in many
question answering applications. We also study this feature
in this paper. Specifically, each word is represented with its
term frequency (tf) value.
Word n-gram (ngram): we utilize word n-gram feature
in our approach. Previous supervised (Li et al. 2008) and
small scale semi-supervised (Li, Liu, and Agichtein 2008)
approaches on QSI observed that the performance gain of
word n-gram compared with word feature was not significant, but we conjecture that it may be due to the sparsity
of their small amount of labeled training data. We investigate whether word n-gram would have significant gain if we

selected. This data set was used as the development set, and
referred to as D.
Classification method: we employed Naive Bayes with
add-one smoothing classification method (Croft, Metzler, and Strohman 2010) in our experiments. Aikawa et
al. (Aikawa, Sakai, and Yamana 2011) found Naive Bayes
was more effective than Support Vector Machines (Hearst et
al. 1998) in classifying subjective and objective questions.
In addition, the training process of Naive Bayes was able
to be parallelized using MapReduce framework (Dean and
Ghemawat 2008).
Metric: precision on subjective questions was used as the
evaluation metric in our experiments. The reason was as follows: a user’s satisfaction would be increased if he/she receives an answer that summarizes people’s opinions for a
subjective question, but his/her satisfaction would not be decreased if he/she receives an answer the same with existing CQA sites that are not equipped with subjective question
identification component. A user’s satisfaction would be decreased if he/she receives a summarized answer that repeats
the fact for an objective question. Thus, precision on subjective questions was the appropriate metric.
Parameter tuning: we performed grid search using different parameter values over D. We ran grid search from 1.0
to 2.5 for α in like signal, from 0.1 to 1.0 for β and γ in
vote signal alternatively, and from 10 to 30 for θ in answer
number signal. The optimal setting was as follows: α = 2.0,
β = 0.2, γ = 0.5 and θ = 20.

Experimental Evaluation

Experimental Setting

Comparison methods: the baseline approach of question
subjectivity identification was supervised learning using labeled training data. In addition, we compared with the stateof-the-art approach CoCQA proposed by Li et al. in (Li, Liu,
and Agichtein 2008). CoCQA was a co-training approach
that exploits the association between the questions and contributed answers.
Dataset: the raw data that was used to collect training data
using social signals was from Yahoo! Answers, and there
was 4, 375, 429 questions with associated answers and social signals. They were relatively popular questions according to user behaviors, and were actively indexed with high
priority in our system. They could be considered as reusable
and valuable resources. In Yahoo! Answers data, rate function was used as the like signal, vote function was used as
the vote signal, source field in the best answer was used as
the source signal, the category poll and survey was used as
the poll and survey signal, and number of answers was used
as the answer number signal. Social signals investigated in
this study are quite general, and other CQA sites could be
leveraged to collect training data as well. The ground truth
data set we used was adapted from Li et al. (Li, Liu, and
Agichtein 2008). They created the data set using Amazon’s
Mechanical Turk service5 . As suggested in (Provost 2000;
Yang et al. 2011), we used a sampling method to deal with
the imbalance problem in their data set, i.e. to keep all objective questions and randomly sample the same number of
subjective questions. We obtained 687 questions in total, and
we referred it as T . We also employed sampling method
when using social signals to collect training data. The same
with Li et al. (Li, Liu, and Agichtein 2008), we reported
the average results of 5-fold cross validation on T for supervised learning and CoCQA. Unlabeled data for CoCQA was
from Liu et al. (Liu, Bian, and Agichtein 2008). The results
of our approach on T were also reported for comparison.
It is worthwhile to point out that our approach did not use
any manually labeled data. To tune the parameters for different social signals, 20% of questions in T were randomly

Effectiveness of Social Signals

We employed different combinations of social signals to automatically collect positive and negative training data, and
used the trained classifier to identify subjective questions.
Table 2 presents the results using word n-gram feature.
Specifically, we employed unigram and bigram for word ngram. By employing co-training over questions and associated answers, CoCQA utilizes some amount of unlabeled
data, and achieves better results than supervised approach.
However, similar with (Li, Liu, and Agichtein 2008), we
found CoCQA achieved optimal performance after adding
3, 000 questions. It means CoCQA could only utilize a small
amount of unlabeled data considering the large volume of
CQA archives.
In Table 2, it is promising to observe that collecting
training data using social signals V + PS + AN achieves
the best results. It improves 9.37% and 5.15% relatively
over supervised and CoCQA respectively. The results indicate the effectiveness of collecting training data using welldesigned social signals for QSI. Selecting training data using
V + AN and AN + S achieve the second and third best performance. Both combinations perform better than supervised
and CoCQA. In addition, social signals of V, AN, S could
be found in almost all CQA sites. Due to the page limit,
we report results of several combinations of social signals.
Other combinations achieve comparable performances. Collecting training data using like signal does not perform well.
We look into the training data, and find that some objective
questions are considered as subjective because their best answers receive fewer likes than other answers. Considering

Table 4 reports the performance of three best performing

data, performances of three approaches all improve accordingly. This finding is encouraging because in practical, we
may integrate training data from several CQA sites with the
same social signal.

Effectiveness of Heuristic Features

Previously, we discussed results of utilizing social signals to
automatically collect training data. In this section, we study
the effectiveness of heuristic features. To allow others to repeat our results, experiments investigating heuristic features
were conducted on the data set T , which contains 687 questions adapted from Li et al. (Li, Liu, and Agichtein 2008).
Question length: Fig. 1 shows the proportion of subjective questions (denoted as Prop-Sub) with respect to questions’ lengths. We rank the questions according to their
lengths in ascending order, and equally partition them into
10 groups. Figures 3, 4, 5, and 6 apply similar methods to
show Prop-Sub with respect to the corresponding features.
Interestingly, we find the proportion of subjective questions
increases as the question length increases. To find out the
reason, we look into the data, and observe that when a user
asks an objective question, he/she just expresses his/her information needs precisely, e.g., “Which player has won the
fa cup twice with 2 different teams?” However, when a user
asks a subjective question, he/she also shares his/her personal opinion together with the question, e.g., “Has anyone
read “Empire” by Orson Scott Card? This is scary. I especially liked the “Afterword” by him. It’s amazing how close
you can feel today to it coming true.”
Request word: Fig. 2 demonstrates the percentage of
subjective questions (denoted as Perc-Sub) with respect to
the number of request word. Group 1 contains questions that
don’t have any request word, group 2 contains questions
having 1 request word, group 3 contains 2 request words,
group 4 contains 3 request words, and group 5 contains at
least 4 request words. Perc-Sub measures the percentage
of subjective questions among all questions in each group.
Quite surprisingly, we find Perc-Sub increases as the number of request words increases. After checking some sample
questions, we conclude the reason is that when users ask

of social signals with varying training data.

the fact that many best answers are chosen by the asker, we
conjecture that this phenomenon may be due to the complex
of best answer selection criteria in CQA sites. Previous work
also found socio-emotional factor affected a lot in the best
answer selection (Kim, Oh, and Oh 2007). We leave the detailed study of how users choose their best answers to our
future work.
Table 3 reports the results of different approaches using
word and word n-gram feature. In line with our intuition, all
approaches achieve better performance using word n-gram
feature compared with word feature. More interestingly,
we find that combinations of social signals, V + PS + AN,
V + AN and AN + S achieve on average 12.27% relative gain
of employing word n-gram over word. But supervised approach only achieves 3.39%, and CoCQA achieves 6.66%
relative gain of using word n-gram over word. We conjecture the reason is as follows: supervised approach only utilizes manually labeled training data, resulting in the sparsity
of employing word n-gram. CoCQA uses several thousand
unlabeled data, and tackles the sparsity problem to some
extent. Training data collected according to social signals
is quite large compared with previous approaches, and data
sparsity problem is better solved.

subjective questions, they also add complicated background
or detailed opinions, making the question quite long. To attract potential answerers, users add these request words.
Subjective clue: in Fig. 3, we can see a clear trend that
the more subjective clues, the larger proportion of subjective
questions. This is an interesting finding that although subjective clues used in our experiments are from other documents,
such as news, they still help distinguish between subjective
and objective questions to some extent.
Punctuation density: in Fig. 4, we observe that the
higher punctuation density, the higher proportion of subjective questions. In other words, the punctuation mark density
of subjective questions is higher than that of objective questions. After examining some examples, we find that users
use short sentence segments when sharing their experiences
in subjective questions. In addition, we conjecture that short
sentence segments help better express users’ feelings and
opinions in asking subjective questions.
Grammatical modifier: in Fig. 5, we find the proportion of subjective questions is positively correlated with the
number of grammatical modifiers. The reason comes from
the observation that grammatical modifiers are commonly
used to describe users’ feelings, experiences, and opinions
in subjective questions. Thus, the more grammatical modifiers used, the larger proportion of subjective questions.
Entity: it is interesting to observe from Fig. 6 that the
proportion of subjective question increases as the number of
entities increases. After investigating some samples, we find
that information needs of objective questions involve fewer
entities compared with subjective questions. The reason is
that subjective questions involve more descriptions, which
also contain entities.
Table 5 shows results of employing heuristic features and
word n-gram. We observe that adding any heuristic feature
to word n-gram would improve precision to some extent,
and employing only heuristic features performs even better

Conclusions

In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for utilizing
social signals in CQA sites. We demonstrate our approach
for one particular important task of automatically identifying
question subjectivity, showing that our approach is able to
leverage social interactions in CQA portals. Despite the inherent difficulties of question subjectivity identification for
real user questions, we have demonstrated that our approach
can significantly improve prediction performance than the
supervised approach (Li et al. 2008) and a state-of-the-art
semi-supervised approach (Li, Liu, and Agichtein 2008). We
also study various heuristic features for QSI, and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of proposed features. In
the future we plan to explore more sophisticated features
such as semantic analysis using natural language processing

169

techniques. We will investigate characteristics of subjective
questions, and study whether we could find popular semantic patterns for subjective questions.
